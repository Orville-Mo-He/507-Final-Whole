      "text": "ROYE, France — There is no doubt that President Emmanuel Macron of France won a convincing re-election over Marine Le Pen, his far-right challenger, on Sunday. Mr. Macron scored a thumping 17 point margin of victory, becoming the first French leader to be re-elected to a second term in 20 years.\nIn the view of many, the electoral system worked as it was intended to, with nearly 60 percent of those who voted joining together to defend against a xenophobic and nationalist far right widely regarded as a threat to French democracy.\nThat is, perhaps, unless you are a supporter of Ms. Le Pen, who was blocked in the final round for a second consecutive time.\n“I think we’re heading into five more years of crisis, probably worse, because people are just fed up,” Sébastien Denneulin, 46, a Le Pen supporter, said on Monday morning in Roye, a northern far-right stronghold.\nEven as Ms. Le Pen has edged her party into the mainstream, ensconcing it firmly in the political establishment, her supporters say they are growing frustrated with a lack of representation in the political system.\nThe far right enjoyed its strongest ever showing at the ballot box on Sunday, as Ms. Le Pen widened her appeal with pocketbook issues important in parts of the country like this northern region, where in the past two generations voters have shifted to the far right from the political left along with deindustrialization.\nThe challenge now for Mr. Macron will be how to lure back into the political fold the 41.5 percent of voters who cast ballots for Ms. Le Pen — and the roughly 28 percent who opted not to vote at all. Despite the president’s clear victory, the election results disguised myriad challenges that could make his next five years in office even more tumultuous than the last.\nAs French news media organizations drew up maps of the nationwide breakdown of the runoff vote, they showed a widening and deepening fracture along the French equivalent of American blue and red states.\nIn the reddest areas of France, there was frustration that Ms. Le Pen had been defeated once again and a strong sentiment that her supporters were continuing to be shut out of the political system.\nIn Roye, some people gathered at the QG brasserie voiced anger when they learned of the results on their smartphones on Sunday evening. One man set fire to his voter’s card.\nTony Rochon, 39, a roofer, said he had voted for a Le Pen — either Marine or her father, Jean-Marie — all of his life. But each time, he said, other political parties had united to deny a Le Pen victory in the presidential race. Then the same thing had happened in legislative elections — also a two-round system — effectively marginalizing Ms. Le Pen’s influence in Parliament.\nIn 2017, for instance, while Ms. Le Pen garnered 34 percent of the vote in the presidential election, her party secured only eight seats in Parliament — not even enough to form a parliamentary group.\nThat year, Mr. Macron promised to introduce proportional representation in Parliament, which experts say would better reflect the population’s political beliefs. But he failed to fulfill his pledge.\n“That’s why the only option for us is to take to the streets,” said Mr. Rochon, who joined the Yellow Vest anti-government protests in Paris. “Macron has no legitimacy.”\nHe and his wife, Adelaide Rochon, 33, a dental assistant who has also always voted for Ms. Le Pen’s party, said they believed that the vote had been rigged.\n“We don’t know a single person around us who voted for Macron,” Ms. Rochon said. “It’s impossible that he won.”\nNot impossible, actually.\nIn Roye, a town of 6,000 people, two out of three voters backed Ms. Le Pen in the runoff. But nationwide Mr. Macron drew many votes — 47 percent, according to one poll — not necessarily because people endorsed him, but because they joined the so-called Republican front against the far right, whose politics remain anathema to a majority of French despite Ms. Le Pen’s persistent efforts to remake and soften her image.\nFor others, like Madeleine Rosier, a member of the leftist France Unbowed, a choice between Mr. Macron and what she deemed an unacceptable far-right candidate was no choice at all. She did not cast a ballot on Sunday after voting for Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the veteran leftist who came in third place in the first round.\n“I didn’t want to grant Emmanuel Macron legitimacy,” she said.\nThe abstention rate — the highest in a runoff since 1969 — reflected the widespread disillusionment with the political system that sent protesters from towns like Roye to the Champs-Élysées in Paris as part of the anti-government Yellow Vest movement in 2018, the biggest political crisis of Mr. Macron’s first term.\nThat anger persists in many pockets of the country. In another measure of political disillusionment, more than three million people cast blank or null-and-void ballots — and that does not include the 13.7 million who opted not to vote at all.\nÉtienne Ollion, a sociologist and professor at the Polytechnique engineering school, said the importance of such voters and those who reluctantly backed Mr. Macron to keep Ms. Le Pen from power, as well as the level of abstention give Mr. Macron “a relatively limited legitimacy.”\nThe election results underscored a growing sense of “democratic fatigue and democratic fracture” in France, Mr. Ollion said.\nGiven Mr. Macron’s unfulfilled pledge to reform Parliament, Chloé Morin, a political scientist at the Jean-Jaurès Foundation, a Paris-based think tank, said there were doubts about Mr. Macron’s “capacity to take into account this extremely divided political landscape and opposition parties that will inevitably, in all logic, be little represented” in Parliament.\nDaniel Cohn-Bendit, an ally of Mr. Macron and a former Green member of the European Parliament, said in an interview that “an unfair French electoral system” had led to governing that ignores the political opposition and various actors of society.\n“To have a Parliament where someone who gets 42 percent of the votes only has about 20 lawmakers, that’s unacceptable,” he said, referring to Ms. Le Pen.\nShortly after Mr. Macron was re-elected on Sunday, there were immediate signs that discontent surrounding French democracy would mark his second term.\nHundreds of protesters gathered in Paris and other big cities to oppose Mr. Macron’s second term. The protests were marred by violent clashes with the police, who fired tear gas in Paris to disperse the crowd.\nProtesters in Paris converged from the city center to the large Place de la République, chanting a song originating from the Yellow Vest movement, “We are here, even if Macron doesn’t want it, we are here!”\nBy midnight, the police had cleared the Place de la République of protesters. But they had scrawled, in red, a warning on the large statue of Marianne, an emblem of the French Republic, in the middle of the square: “Beware of revenge when all the poor people stand up.”",

      "headline": "As mask mandates end, Canada’s Atlantic provinces see a virus resurgence.",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/world/canada/canadas-atlantic-provinces-covid-masks.html",
      "text": "In Canada’s Atlantic provinces, once a refuge of sorts from the pandemic, there has been a resurgence of known coronavirus infections at a time when most provinces have ended mask mandates and scaled back data surveillance on virus transmission.\nThe four eastern provinces — Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island — were relatively shielded, in part by their location, from the rampant virus transmission that gripped the rest of Canada during previous waves. Part of the strategy was to limit out-of-province travelers in what came to be known as the Atlantic “bubble.”\nThe “bubble” has burst, but inter-province travel is less of a concern for public health experts than the effects of recently ended mandates.\n“We’ve started removing masks, which for Canada is a big deal,” said Tara Moriarty, an infectious disease researcher and professor at the University of Toronto.\nBut measuring the effect of changes in public health restrictions is hampered by a lack of public data, as most provinces have reduced the frequency of their reporting.\n“The consequences are really serious in terms of the number of infections because people think that things are not too bad and they’re behaving accordingly,” Dr. Moriarty said.\nIn Nova Scotia, a province of about one million people, positive coronavirus test results have been rising since March, though the numbers may be “stabilizing,” according to a report issued by its public health authority. In Canada as a whole, the daily average of new cases is 10,073, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.\nSome infectious disease experts, including Dr. Lisa Barrett, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, have been recommending to the province that indoor mask mandates stay in place, and it’s unclear what the threshold would be to revive some public health measures.\n“It’s really hard for people, without data being reported more frequently, to remember that we’re in a pandemic,” said Dr. Barrett, adding that the mask provided a useful visual cue.\nNewfoundland and Labrador has also reduced its daily data reporting; the province recorded its highest number of Covid deaths in April.\nAmy Hurford, an expert in infectious disease modeling at Memorial University in St. John’s, Newfoundland, has created her own dashboard.\n“I think it fills a need, where people can get a better sense of situational awareness, by synthesizing the information that’s available from a number of different sources,” Dr. Hurford said.\nCanada’s overall test positivity rate is 18 percent, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.\nDespite a rise in hospitalization rates across some jurisdictions, critical care occupancy remains low, said Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, in a news conference on Friday.\nBooster shots also appear to have plateaued, months after the winter holiday frenzy to book limited appointments. About 81 percent of Canadians are fully vaccinated, and just over 47 percent have also received a booster, according to government data.\n“We probably haven’t done enough good communication from all angles, public health and otherwise. And so we’re trying to do that once again, and give it another shot,” Dr. Tam said.",

      "headline": "Kenneth Roth, ‘Godfather’ of Human Rights Work, to Step Down",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/world/americas/kenneth-roth-human-rights-watch.html",
      "text": "Kenneth Roth said he first learned about human rights abuses from his father, whose Jewish family ran a butchery near Frankfurt in Hitler’s Germany. His father, Mr. Roth recalled, would describe how the Nazis forced the Jews into segregated schools, a precursor for much worse to come.\nWhile Nazi Germany was radically different from Mr. Roth’s own childhood in Deerfield, Ill., he said, “I grew up with this awareness of the evil governments can do.”\nNow, after nearly three decades of leading Human Rights Watch from an obscure shoestring network of a few scattered offices into a well-financed organization that reports on rights abuses globally, Mr. Roth, 66, a Yale-educated lawyer and former prosecutor, said he is stepping down in August to write a book.\nWord of his impending departure, announced Tuesday, was likely to reverberate through the world of human rights fund-raising and advocacy, where the group he has led is a powerful force.\n“I felt it important to leave when things are going well at H.R.W.,” Mr. Roth said in a telephone interview.\nMr. Roth has been an unrelenting irritant to authoritarian governments, exposing human rights abuses with documented research reports that have become the group’s specialty.\nThe reports have been a catalyst for media coverage and advocacy involving issues from the Ethiopian conflict that has forced millions to flee their homes, to grave abuses against Yemenis by the antagonists in Yemen’s protracted war, to how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, historically a leading grain exporter, is exacerbating hunger across the Middle East and North Africa.\nJoel Simon, former head of the Committee to Protect Journalists, an advocacy group that once shared offices with Mr. Roth’s organization, described him as the “godfather” of the human rights movement.\n“We have to credit H.R.W. with changing the way journalists and the media as an institution approach the issue of human rights,” Mr. Simon said.\nMr. Roth described the inception of his career as “inauspicious.” After six years of volunteering at Human Rights Watch, Mr. Roth became the deputy director in 1987. He was appointed executive director in 1993. “I’d never raised a cent of funds in my life,” Mr. Roth said of his appointment.\nUnder Mr. Roth’s leadership, an organization with 20 employees and regional committees in Europe and the Americas expanded into 450 employees with operations in 100 countries.\nWith a lawyer’s courtroom vigor, perhaps derived from his prior career as a federal prosecutor in New York and for the Iran-contra investigation, Mr. Roth has antagonized many autocrats.\nJust this month, the government of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia shut down the group from operating in the country as part of his broad crackdown on dissent over the Ukraine war.\nIn 2014, Mr. Roth was denied entry into Egypt because of a report implicating senior officials, including Egypt’s current president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, in the “widespread and systematic” killings of protesters after the ousting of former President Mohamed Morsi.\nIn 2020, Mr. Roth was turned away at Hong Kong International Airport on arrival from New York. He was there to release his organization’s annual report summarizing human rights abuses. The lead essay — written by Mr. Roth — argued that China, which controls Hong Kong, was undermining international human rights.\nMr. Roth said China’s behavior will remain one of his biggest concerns long after his departure from his group.\n“China is trying to assert its model as a superior model to democracy, saying ‘We’ve expanded the economy, we’ve fought off Covid,” he said. “They don’t want you to ask, ‘How did Covid start?’ They don’t want you to ask how the worse off segments of society are faring, because they don’t want you to ask how the Uyghurs, Tibetans or even rural Han Chinese are doing.”\nMr. Roth has also angered the leaders of Western democracies. He was an outspoken critic of the isolationist, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim actions by the Trump administration and the rights abuses and surveillance that grew out of the so-called War on Terror after the Sept. 11 attacks.\nAfter four years of Donald J. Trump’s presidency, the Biden administration was not a remedy, Mr. Roth said. But he said that under President Biden, who declared his foreign policy would be guided by human rights principles, U.S. attitudes were improving.\nIn December, the Senate voted unanimously to approve legislation that would ban products made in China’s Xinjiang region, over concerns about forced labor by persecuted Muslim minorities.\nAlso, the United States has rejoined the U.N. Human Rights Council, revived membership in the World Health Organization, re-entered the Paris climate accord and restored funding to a number of U.N. agencies.\nBut, Mr. Roth said, “the Middle East is a lacuna in this declared willingness to be guided by human rights.”\nHe pointed to the U.S. government’s engagement with Saudi Arabia despite its internal repression and indiscriminate bombings of Yemenis. And he said there had been “no evolution” in U.S. policy on Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, particularly in Gaza.\nThe Israeli government reacted furiously last year to a Human Rights Watch report that argued it pursues a policy of Jewish supremacy over Palestinians, in Israel and the occupied territories. The report said this policy met the legal definition of apartheid.\nMr. Roth has been accused of anti-Semitism for his criticism of Israel.\n“In his 30 year reign as head of H.R.W., Ken Roth has obsessively distorted and exploited human rights to demonize Israel,” said Gerald M. Steinberg, a professor at Bar Ilan University in Israel who has written Op-Eds about Mr. Roth in the Jerusalem Post.\nIsrael also played a role in internal frictions at Mr. Roth’s group. Its founder, Robert L. Bernstein, wrote an op-ed for The New York Times in 2009 distancing himself from the organization because of what he called its portrayal of Israel as a “pariah state.”\nMr. Roth has rejected such criticisms. Implicit in their arguments, Mr. Roth said, was the flawed assumption that democracies are immune to committing human rights violations. He pointed to former President George W. Bush, whose administration established the Guantánamo detention facility for Sept. 11 attack suspects, and condoned waterboarding as an interrogation technique.\n“The idea that human rights groups should ignore Guantánamo and the torture just because it was committed by a democracy was preposterous,” Mr. Roth said.\nMr. Roth’s wife, Dr. Annie Sparrow, an Australian pediatrician and fellow human-rights advocate, recalled the first time she watched him debateMichael Ignatieff, a former Harvard professor and Canadian lawmaker who had supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Mr. Roth, she said, “annihilated” his opponent.\n“I was impressed enough to think if I ever did want to get married, I could marry that man,” she said. The couple married in 2011.\nIt remains unclear who will succeed Mr. Roth.\n“I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who could mount an ironclad argument and beat up on dictators with the clarity, confidence and the capacity that Ken has,” Dr. Sparrow said. “Who is going to beat up on the dictators now?”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/world/europe/explosions-transnistria-moldova-war.html",
      "text": "BRUSSELS — A series of explosions on Monday and Tuesday has rattled Transnistria, a small breakaway region within Moldova and bordering Ukraine, ramping up fears that the war next door could spill over into neighboring countries and swell into a wider conflict.\nIt remained unclear on Tuesday who was behind the attacks in Transnistria, a self-declared Republic allied with — and heavily dependent on — Russia. Local authorities there blamed Ukraine, while Ukraine accused Russia of orchestrating the blasts as a pretext for further aggression.\nThe Ukrainian military said Tuesday that Russian troops stationed in Transnistria had been put on high alert. Some Ukrainians have voiced fears that with Russia already invading their country from the east, south and north, they could add a new front from Transnistria, attacking from the west, as well.\nMoldova, a former Soviet republic, said the explosions were still under investigation, though one interior ministry official said some initial evidence suggested Russian involvement.\nAs the Soviet Union dissolved in the early 1990s, heavily armed separatists in Transnistria, which has a sizable minority of Russian speakers, fought to break away from Moldova. With Russian backing, they effectively won independence, but Transnistria is not formally recognized internationally.\nThere are at least 12,000 Russian troops stationed in Transnistria, which reached to within 25 miles of Odesa, Ukraine’s chief port and third-largest city. Odesa is potentially a major target in Moscow’s stalled push to seize Ukraine’s Black Sea coast.\nA Russian general said last week that Russia intended to take control of a swath of land extending not just to Crimea, the peninsula it seized from Ukraine in 2014, but all the way to Transnistria. But it was not clear that his statement reflected Kremlin policy.\nThe attacks in Transnistria were carried out against empty or unused buildings during a holiday, and there were no casualties, said Moldova’s deputy interior minister, Sergiu Diaconu. He said explosions appeared to be an attempt to destabilize the country, and possibly serve as an excuse for a military response by Russia, not a serious bid to do harm.\nIn addition, Mr. Diaconu said, the grenades that were used are produced by Russia and are only used by the armies of Russia, Transnistria and Gabon. He said of the attackers, “I don’t think these were the Gabonese.”\nStill, Moldovan authorities did not accuse Moscow of being behind the explosions. The country’s president, Maia Sandu, did not mention Russia when asked on Tuesday about the attacks, saying only that there were “tensions between different forces within the regions, interested in destabilizing the situation.”\nThere were three separate explosions, local authorities in Transnistria said. One targeted a security-agency building in the capital, Tiraspol. The other blasts hit the local airport and a radio station in the village of Mayak.\nVadim Krasnoselsky, the president of Transnistria’s separatist government, called the explosions “terrorist attacks” and blamed Ukraine. “Traces of these attacks lead to Ukraine,” he said in a statement, without providing details. “I assume that those who organized this attack have the goal of dragging Transnistria into the conflict.”\nFor their part, Ukrainian officials were quick to point a finger at Russia. The Ukrainian defense ministry said its intelligence indicated that the explosions were “a planned provocation” by Russia aimed at inflaming “anti-Ukrainian sentiments.”\nRussia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said on Tuesday that “forces disinterested in regional stability and wishing to create another hotbed of tensions are behind this.” He did not say who those forces were.\nTransnistria, with a mixed population of Romanian, Russian and Ukrainian speakers, has been a problem for Moldova’s government for more than three decades, since retired Soviet military officers living there led the rebellion.\n“Transnistria was artificially created to keep Moldova threatened all the time,” said Alexandru Flenchea, Moldova’s former deputy prime minister.\nSince the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, the Moldovan authorities have been increasingly anxious over the possibility that Russia might activate its Transnistria-based troops, either to attack Ukraine or to invade Moldova, which is not a member of NATO or the European Union, and has limited military forces.\nMr. Flenchea said the people running Transnistria might not be keen on war because it would interfere with one of the region’s major economic activities, smuggling.\nIulian Groza, the head of the Institute for European Policies and Reforms, a research institution in the Moldovan capital, Chisinau, said a Russian invasion of Moldova did not appear to be imminent. The short-term aim of the Russians, Mr. Groza said, seemed to be to destabilize the region and undermine the pro-European Union government of Moldova.\nWhether the threat of an invasion is real or not, Moldovans are worried. Many people reacted to the news about the Transnistria explosions in a similar way as they did to the outbreak of the invasion of Ukraine — fearing the worst.\n“People are in panic again,” said Carmina Vicol, the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Chisinau. “The worst case is that war starts here and disrupts everything.”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/world/europe/angela-rayner-sexism-misogyny-britain-parliament-mail-on-sunday.html",
      "text": "LONDON — An anonymously sourced report by one of Britain’s freewheeling tabloid newspapers has sparked a debate over both tabloid journalistic ethics and sexism in Parliament, leading some to question whether the institution is capable shedding its fusty reputation and becoming an inclusive workplace.\nOver the weekend the tabloid, The Mail on Sunday, reported an anonymous claim by a Conservative lawmaker that Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the opposition Labour Party, had tried distracting Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Parliament by crossing and uncrossing her legs, comparing her to Sharon Stone’s character in the film “Basic Instinct.”\nMs. Rayner said the article had left her “crestfallen.” It was dismissed by Mr. Johnson as “sexist, misogynist, tripe,” and prompted more than 5,500 complaints, according to the independent regulator of most of Britain’s newspapers and magazines. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, summoned the newspaper’s editor, David Dillon, and its political editor, Glen Owen, to a meeting on Wednesday.\n“The story is that there is misogyny alive and well and stalking the corridors of the House of Commons,” said Harriet Harman, the longest-serving female lawmaker and a lifelong champion of women’s rights. It was, she told LBC Radio, symptomatic of “the backlash you always get when women are making progress,” adding that “there are some men that feel they’ve got to put them back.”\nThere are 454 women and 963 men in the House of Commons and House of Lords. Before the last general election in 2019, a number of female politicians said harassment and abuse had driven some out of politics; many rights groups worry that the culture in Parliament has deterred others from coming forward at all to run for office.\nRepeated phone calls and emails to The Mail on Sunday went unanswered.\nJemima Olchawski, the chief officer of the Fawcett Society, a leading British charity that supports gender equality and women’s rights said in a statement, “This behavior cannot be tolerated — as a nation we cannot and should not accept this.” She noted that her organization had long campaigned for “systemic changes to fix Parliament’s culture and make it a more inclusive and diverse workplace.”\nAside from its sexist tone and content, the article also contrasted Ms. Rayner’s start in life with Mr. Johnson’s elite education and his public speaking skills honed at the Oxford Union, the university’s famous debating society. Born working class, she was a young single mother who has risen to one of the most prominent jobs in British politics.\nMs. Rayner has also won praise for her debating style while standing in at several sessions of Prime Minister’s questions, the weekly verbal duel between party leaders in Parliament.\nIn a TV interview on Tuesday Ms. Rayner described how, when contacted by The Mail on Sunday, she told the paper the claim was untrue, asked them not to publish it and was “crestfallen” about the impact it might have on her teenage sons.\nThe article was steeped in class bias, she told ITV, focusing on “where I come from and how I grew up,” and suggesting that, because of her standard, state-school education she was “stupid.”\n“They talk about my background because I had a child when I was young as if to say I am promiscuous — that was the insinuation, which I felt was quite offensive,” Ms. Rayner added.\nAfter the article’s publication, several lawmakers expressed support for Ms. Rayner and voiced fears about damage to the reputation of a Parliament that has faced several scandals in recent years. On the same day as The Mail on Sunday was writing about Ms. Rayner, the Sunday Times of London reported that three cabinet ministers and two senior Labour politicians were among 56 lawmakers facing allegations of bullying, harassment and sexual misconduct.\nJane Merrick, policy editor at the i newspaper — who was among those named as person of the year by Time magazine in 2017 for talking publicly about sexual abuse and harassment in Parliament — criticized the article, pointing out that Ms. Rayner often outperformed Mr. Johnson in debate. “To reduce this to what she’s wearing and how she behaves, I think is ludicrous, but also completely steeped in misogyny,” she said.\nMs. Merrick added that the workplace culture had improved in Parliament since she began working there more than two decades ago, but that it was depressing that more still needed to be done.\n“I think there was a kind of a rush of optimism when Me Too happened that we would suddenly change people’s behavior, and, of course, that never happened,” she said.\nMandu Reid, the leader of the Women’s Equality Party, a feminist political party, said the story raised broader issues.\n“This wouldn’t be a story at all if Westminster and the wider political system in the U.K. weren’t riddled with misogyny,” she said in a statement. She also pointed to “the misogyny of the media, which both deters women from involvement and misrepresents and undersells their achievements when they do engage.”\nMany have long criticized a culture in Parliament where the number of female lawmakers is not yet reflective of the communities they represent.\nThe representation of women in Parliament is at a high, but women still make up just 35 percent of lawmakers elected to the House of Commons and 28 percent of the members of the House of Lords.\nSpeaking on Monday, Mr. Johnson said he had offered Ms. Rayner his support and had promised that if the source of the article were uncovered, then the “terrors of the earth” would be unleashed upon them.\nThat person, he said, was not giving an authorized briefing.\nJames Heappey, a junior defense minister, on Tuesday told the BBC that he worried about the damage to the reputation of a Parliament that was “in a bad place right now,” and described the incident as “offensive and ridiculous.”\nAs for his anonymous fellow Conservative lawmaker who inspired the report, Mr. Heappey described them as an “idiot of a colleague.”",

      "headline": "As Diplomacy Hopes Dim, U.S. Marshals Allies to Furnish Long-Term Military Aid to Ukraine",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-germany-weapons.html",
      "text": "RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany — The United States marshaled 40 allies on Tuesday to furnish Ukraine with long-term military aid in what could become a protracted battle against the Russian invasion, and Germany said it would send dozens of armored antiaircraft vehicles. It was a major policy shift for a country that had wavered over fear of provoking Russia.\nThe announcement by Germany, Europe’s biggest economy and one of Russia’s most important Western trading partners, was among many signals on Tuesday pointing to further escalation in the war and disappointment for diplomacy.\nGermany’s shift on weapons also was seen as a strong affirmation of a toughened message by the Biden administration, which has said it wants to see Russia not only defeated in Ukraine but seriously weakened from the conflict that President Vladimir V. Putin began two months ago.\nThe increasing flow of Western weapons into Ukraine — including howitzers, armed drones, tanks and ammunition — also amounted to another sign that a war Mr. Putin had expected would divide his Western adversaries had instead drawn them much closer together.\n“Putin never imagined that the world would rally behind Ukraine so swiftly and surely,” the American defense secretary, Lloyd J. Austin III, said on Tuesday to uniformed and civilian officials at the U.S. air base in Ramstein, Germany, where he convened defense officials from 40 allied countries.\n“Nobody is fooled” by Mr. Putin’s “phony claims on Donbas,” Mr. Austin said, referring to the eastern region of Ukraine, where Russia recently refocused its assaults. “Russia’s invasion is indefensible and so are Russian atrocities,” he said.\nRussia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said on Tuesday that the influx of heavy weapons from Western countries was effectively pushing Ukraine to sabotage peace talks with Moscow, which have shown no concrete signs of progress.\n“They will continue that line by filling Ukraine with weapons,” Mr. Lavrov said after meeting in Moscow with the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, who was undertaking his most active effort yet at diplomacy to halt the war. “If that continues, negotiations won’t yield any result.”\nOn Monday, Mr. Lavrov resurrected the specter of nuclear war, as Mr. Putin has done at least twice before. Mr. Lavrov said that while such a possibility would be “unacceptable” to Russia, the risks had increased because NATO had “engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and arming that proxy.”\n“The risks are quite considerable,” he said in an interview with Channel One, Russia’s state-run TV network.\n“I don’t want them to be blown out of proportion,” he said. But “the danger is serious, real — it must not be underestimated.”\nUkraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, called Mr. Lavrov’s remarks a sign that “Moscow senses defeat in Ukraine.” John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, called them “obviously unhelpful, not constructive.”\n“A nuclear war cannot be won and it shouldn’t be fought,” he said. “There’s no reason for the current conflict in Ukraine to get to that level at all.”\nMr. Austin said the defense officials who had gathered at Ramstein Air Base — from Australia, Belgium, Britain, Italy, Israel and other countries — had agreed to form what he called the Ukraine Contact Group and to meet monthly to ensure they “strengthen Ukraine’s military for the long haul.”\n“We are going to keep moving heaven and earth,” to bolster the Ukrainian military, Mr. Austin said.\nGermany’s defense minister, Christine Lambrecht, announced at the meeting that Berlin would send Ukraine up to 50 armed vehicles, called Flakpanzer Gepard, designed to shoot down aircraft but also fire at targets on the ground.\nAlthough no longer used by Germany, they have been acquired by Jordan, Qatar, Romania and Brazil, where they have been deployed to defend soccer stadiums from potential drone attacks during international tournaments, according to the manufacturer, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann.\nThe German government had previously cited a range of reasons to avoid shipping such heavy arms to Ukraine, including that none were readily available, that training Ukrainian soldiers to operate them was time-consuming, and that Russia could be provoked into a wider conflict.\nBut German officials changed course under growing pressure from the conservative opposition in Berlin, and from members of the governing coalition. Germany has also supplied Ukraine with shoulder-launched antitank rockets and surface-to-air defensive missiles, some from old East German stockpiles.\nSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken, who traveled with Mr. Austin to Ukraine this past weekend, affirmed on Tuesday that the United States would support the Ukrainian military in pushing Russian forces out of eastern Ukraine if that is what President Volodymyr Zelensky aims to do.\n“If that is how they define their objectives as a sovereign, democratic, independent country, that’s what we’ll support,” Mr. Blinken said at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\nAfter meeting with Mr. Putin in the Kremlin, Mr. Guterres said he had secured an agreement “in principle” to allow the United Nations and the Red Cross to evacuate civilians from a sprawling steel plant besieged by Russia in the southern Ukrainian port of Mariupol, where they have been holed up for days with Ukrainian fighters. But there was no evidence that the meeting had produced any advances in diplomacy to end the war.\nBefore the meeting, Mr. Putin asserted that Mr. Guterres had been “misled” about the situation in Mariupol, and he insisted that Russia had been operating workable humanitarian corridors out of the city — an assertion denied by Ukrainian officials, who say their attempts to ferry civilians out of the city have collapsed in the face of threats by Russian forces.\nMr. Putin told Mr. Guterres that he hoped continuing peace talks with Ukraine would bring “some positive result,” according to the Kremlin. But Mr. Putin said Russia would not sign a security guarantee agreement with Ukraine without a resolution to the territorial questions in Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, and in Donbas, where Russia has recognized two separatist regions as independent.\nIn an escalation of the East-West economic conflict from the war, Poland’s state-owned gas company said on Tuesday that Russia’s state gas company had announced the “complete suspension” of natural gas deliveries to Poland through a major pipeline.\nPoland, a NATO member and key conduit for Western arms into Ukraine, gets more than 45 percent of its natural gas from Russia, and cutting off that supply could impair its ability to heat homes and run businesses.\nIn addition to spreading suffering and death across Ukraine, the invasion has set off the largest exodus of European refugees since World War II.\nMore than five million people, 90 percent of them women and children, have already left Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, according to the United Nations. A further 7.7 million have been driven from their homes by the conflict, but remain in the country.\nOn Tuesday, the United Nations projected that the number of refugees could rise to 8.3 million by year’s end, and it asked donors for an additional $1.25 billion to finance soaring humanitarian needs in Ukraine.\nIn another worrisome sign of possible spillover from the war, explosions rattled Transnistria, a small Moscow-backed breakaway republic in Ukraine’s southwest neighbor, Moldova, for the second consecutive day.\nIt remained unclear who was behind the explosions. The authorities in Transnistria blamed Ukraine, while Ukraine accused Russia of having orchestrated the blasts.\nMoldova’s president, Maia Sandu, told reporters that there were “tensions between different forces within the regions, interested in destabilizing the situation.”\nAt least 12,000 Russian troops are stationed in Transnistria, just 25 miles from Ukraine’s major port, Odesa. Western officials have expressed concerns that Mr. Putin might create a pretext to order more troops into the territory, just as he did before Russian forces moved into Crimea and Donbas.",

      "text": "WARSAW — Infuriated by the West’s supply of arms and other support to help Ukraine resist invading Russian troops, Moscow on Tuesday took the fight to Europe’s economy, telling Poland and Bulgaria that it was halting supplies of natural gas, on which both countries and Europe in general are heavily dependent. \nA decision by Russia’s energy behemoth Gazprom to cut off gas supplies to two countries that are both members of NATO and the European Union marks the first time that Moscow has directly and openly targeted Europe with its energy weapon. The move upends assurances by Moscow since the Soviet era that, no matter what the political climate, Russia could be counted on as a reliable supplier of natural gas.\nEuropean countries have suffered sporadic interruptions in Russian gas supplies in the past, but these were largely the result of squabbles between Russia and Ukraine over what Gazprom claimed were unpaid bills and the theft of gas destined for Europe through a pipeline that crosses Ukrainian territory.\nOn Tuesday, however, Poland’s main importer of Russian gas, the state-owned company PGNiG, said that Gazprom had announced the “complete suspension” of deliveries through the Yamal pipeline, which stretches from northern Siberia to Poland and Germany through Belarus. \nPGNiG said that it had received a letter from Gazprom informing it that all deliveries through the Yamal pipeline were being halted. \nBulgaria’s energy ministry said later on Tuesday that it, too, had been told by Gazprom that its own gas supplies from Russia, which flow through the Ukrainian pipeline, would stop.\nGermany also receives some gas through the Yamal pipeline but most of what it needs from Russia flows through Nord Stream, a separate pipeline under the Baltic Sea that appeared to be still operating normally on Tuesday.\nPoland, the biggest economy in Europe’s formerly communist east, gets more than 45 percent of its gas from Russia, while Bulgaria gets around 90 percent.\nSince Russian invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, both countries have announced plans to wean themselves off Russian energy, but the abrupt halt announced on Tuesday could seriously wound the ability of both countries to heat homes and run businesses.\nBut with winter now over, warming temperatures should help lessen the blow in both, at least in coming months. Unlike some of its neighbors, Poland burns coal, not gas, for most of its electricity, so it is less vulnerable on that front. \nPoland’s climate minister, Anna Moskwa, played down the impact of Russia’s decision, insisting at a news conference in Warsaw on Tuesday that “we are ready to be fully cut off” from Russian gas. Bulgaria’s energy ministry, in a statement, assured consumers that “currently, no restrictions are required on gas consumption in Bulgaria.”\nRussia’s decision nonetheless marked a significant ratcheting up of tensions with the European Union, which, since Russia invaded Ukraine, has joined the United States in imposing increasingly stringent economic sanctions, badly damaging the Russian economy.\nBoth Poland and Bulgaria, along with other European countries except for Hungary, rejected a demand by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that energy purchases be paid for in rubles to help prop up his currency, though the contracts for foreign sales generally require payment in dollars.\nRussia has been particularly angry at Poland because of Warsaw’s robust support for Ukraine, which has received many of its NATO-supplied arms through Polish territory and from which nearly three millions refugees have fled across the Polish border.\nBulgaria is traditionally more pro-Russian than most other European countries, particularly Poland, but it nonetheless endorsed European Union sanctions against Russia — unlike Serbia, a Russia-friendly country that is not a member of the European bloc. Bulgaria’s new coalition government has been convulsed by tension over whether to send arms to Ukraine.\nRussia has made clear for months that it will favor countries that don’t criticize it with reliable supplies of energy. During a visit in Moscow from Hungary’s Kremlin-friendly leader, Viktor Orban, shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine, Mr. Putin offered assurances that Hungary, unlike other European countries, did not have to worry about running short of natural gas.\nIn a sarcastic message on social media last month, Dmitri Medvedev, the deputy head of the Kremlin’s security council and a longtime ally of Mr. Putin, sneered at European leaders as fools for taking measures against Russia that he said would ensure they don’t have enough energy.\n“Excellent. The wise decisions of European politicians,” Mr. Medvedev wrote.\nThe bloc has vowed to cut off its large imports of Russian oil and coal over a period of months, as it searches for replacements and adjusts to higher fuel costs. But Europe is even more dependent on Russian gas, and ending those imports would be more economically damaging; E.U. ministers have said they will reduce the flow from Russia, but not shut it off until 2030.",

      "headline": "Standing in the path of war, a small Ukrainian town braces as Russians advance.",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/world/europe/front-line-town-orikhiv.html",
      "text": "ORIKHIV, Ukraine — Squeezed between the Ukrainian and Russian front lines in an increasingly volatile battlefield in southeastern Ukraine, the small town of Orikhiv is constantly under fire, and Tamara Mikheenko, one of the few residents who remain, rarely leaves her basement.\n“All the time in the basements, at night, under fire,” Ms. Mikheenko, 70, said as yet another explosion thumped outside. “It’s very scary, like a lightning bolt, everything is falling apart, the house is falling apart.”\nStruggling to communicate through tremendous sobs on Tuesday, Ms. Mikheenko begged world leaders, including the presidents of the United States, Russia and Ukraine, to do whatever was necessary to stop the savagery, even as Russian forces appeared to be preparing a large offensive that officials said could steamroll Orikhiv in the coming days.\n“Let them agree to stop this madness,” she said.\nThe night before, an explosion had ripped into the unoccupied house next door, violently jolting the dark cellar Ms. Mikheenko was hiding in.\nOrikhiv lies among a small constellation of tidy farming villages standing right in the path of Russian troops advancing from the south and east. Ukrainian officials believe Russian forces are preparing to make a major push forward in an attempt to expand a stretch of territory they seized in the opening days of the war.\nShelling along this front has intensified in recent days, and all over the region Ukrainian forces are digging new trenches and fortifying positions.\nIt is in and around these villages, still home to goats, cows and chickens, but to fewer and fewer people, that the current, pivotal phase of the war is being fought. After failing to take the capital, Kyiv, and meeting as yet impenetrable resistance along Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has turned the remaining might of his army on the fertile plains east of Ukraine’s Dnipro River and a few key major cities.\n\n\nAlready, Russian forces have gobbled up nearly 80 percent of the Donbas region, as well as a ribbon of land connecting Russian territory to the Crimean Peninsula, which Mr. Putin annexed in 2014. One by one, the towns south and east of Orikhiv have fallen into Russian hands.\nUkraine’s forces, primarily from the 128th Separate Mountain Assault Brigade, are now dug into the wooded patches around and between these villages and the vast fields of wheat and sunflowers that are tended by their residents. Soldiers from the brigade say they are preparing to halt the expected Russian offensive and even to push the Russian lines back.\nBut should Orikhiv also fall, Russian forces will have a nearly open path to the large industrial metropolis of Zaporizhzhia, just under 40 miles away. Zaporizhzhia’s prewar population of about 750,000 has swelled with the daily arrival of evacuees from nearby territory now occupied by Russian forces, including the battered port city of Mariupol.\nAround Zaporizhzhia, a sense of impending danger is palpable. Air raid sirens now sound several times a day and the local military hospital is filled with troops coming in from the front lines with ghastly injuries. On Tuesday, Russia’s military launched a rocket attack against targets inside the city, narrowly missing its nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe when fully operational, according to officials. The rockets hit a city utility, killing one person, though the local government provided no further details.\nSince the start of the war on Feb. 24, rocket attacks have been rare in Zaporizhzhia. Not so in Orikhiv. The town is just three miles from the Russian lines, and shelling occurs around the clock, becoming particularly intense in the evenings. Several houses were hit overnight on Tuesday, including the one belonging to Ms. Mikheenko’s neighbor, Vitaliy Kononenko.\n“This is what the Russian world has brought us,” Mr. Kononenko said, inspecting the large hole punched through the front of his home. Inside, plastic ceiling panels had melted and the fur of a large teddy bear sitting in the window of a child’s room was singed.\nThe house, which Mr. Kononenko said he had recently finished building, would have burned to the ground had Ms. Mikheenko’s son, Aleksandr, not dashed from the basement to put it out.\nOrikhiv’s mayor, Kostyantin Denisov, said that, miraculously, the city has suffered no casualties despite the constant shelling. This is partly because of the decision early on to evacuate as many people as possible. Today, only about 30 percent of the city’s prewar population of 20,000 remains, he said.\nSome of those still in the city, like Ms. Mikheenko, stay holed up in their basements, but not everyone does. On Tuesday, among the clusters of neat single-family homes was the occasional resident fussing about in a beautiful blooming front garden. The sounds of gunfire, apparently target practice, sounded in the distance.\nMr. Denisov has stayed in place, refusing to leave his office in the peach-colored City Hall building. He is needed, he said, to help with the city’s defense. It is not an easy task, as the 251-year-old town was once located on a number of trade routes and has at least seven roads leading into it.\n“Now we have to close these routes off from our uninvited guests,” he said. “That’s our main task. We won’t surrender.”\nThe towns running horizontally along the southeastern Ukrainian front are like touchstones marking the course of the Russian advance. Polohy, about 25 miles to the east of Orikhiv, has already fallen to Russian forces.\nTo the northwest is Komyshuvakha, which Russian forces came dangerously close to until about two weeks ago, when Ukrainian defenders pushed them back. On Tuesday, the biggest drama of the day was the escape of a black and white cow from Natalia Novitskaya’s yard.\nBut the ravages of war were still present. In front of Ms. Novitskaya’s house is a crater large enough to swallow a small sedan. The blast from the bomb, which struck on March 16, blew out windows and gave one of her sons a concussion, she said.\nLocals also showed off the remnants of what appeared to be incendiary weapons that rained down on their homes and fields in the early days of the fighting.\nDespite the relative calm now, officials and residents of Komyshuvakha are preparing for the Russians’ return. On Tuesday, backhoes were digging fresh trenches along the sides of the road and soldiers were stocking up on food at the local market.\n“We don’t know what they have in their heads, but we are fortifying,” said Yuriy Karapetyan, the mayor. “We are preparing for the worst and will resist until the last.”",

      "headline": "Baking Challah in Dubai: A Jewish Community Heads Out Into the Open",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/world/middleeast/dubai-jewish-community.html",
      "text": "DUBAI — Two rows of tables covered in glossy runners, mixing bowls, wooden spatulas and containers of yeast, sugar, eggs, oil, flour and salt lined the garden of a villa set to host nearly 60 women.\nAs the guests arrived, each received a pink apron inscribed with the name of the event in big bold type: Dubai Challah Bake.\n“This is not the first time we’re making challah,” said Chevie Kogan, a Jewish community organizer and Hebrew teacher in Dubai, a glitzy city-state in the United Arab Emirates. “But it is definitely the first time we have so many ladies gathered together to do the mitzvah of our precious challah.”\nWhile Jews have long lived and worked comfortably in Dubai, they kept their religious expression mostly quiet. But in the two years since the United Arab Emirates normalized relations with Israel, the Jewish community in this Persian Gulf emirate has grown significantly and felt freer than ever to express its traditions and religious identity.\nIt is one of the many signs of an emerging new reality in the Middle East, where Israel’s isolation in the Arab world is ebbing. And though the United Arab Emirates was not the first Arab country to normalize relations, the oil-rich state — a leading political force in the Middle East — appears to be charting a path for a warmer peace that could herald a new era in Arab-Israeli relations.\nAt a recent Middle East summit where top diplomats from the United States, Israel and four Arab countries met for the first time on Israeli soil, the Emirati foreign minister called his Israeli counterpart “not only a partner” but a friend. He lamented decades of lost opportunities and celebrated how 300,000 Israelis had visited the Emirates in the past year and a half.\n“Although Israel has been part of this region for a very long time, we’ve not known each other,” the minister, Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan, said at the meeting. “So it’s time to catch up, to build on a stronger relationship.”\nThe two countries have bonded in part over security concerns and their shared view of Iran as a threat.\nBut even before the summit, the challah-baking party in Dubai in late February was one of many fruits of this warming relationship. The guests trickled in shortly after sunset, the majority of them Jewish with many recent arrivals from Israel who came to visit or to live.\nLike Adi Levi, 38, who moved with her husband and three sons from the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon just over a year ago. Or Avital Schneller, 37, who came on a short visit from Tel Aviv last year, then stayed to start a tourism business.\nAnother guest, Iska Hajeje, 24, said she had left her Orthodox Jewish family back in the Israeli city of Netanya and landed a job selling makeup in the lavish Dubai Mall, where shoppers stroll next to sharks swimming behind the glass walls of its extravagant aquarium.\nApart from seeking jobs or other business opportunities, all of these newcomers said they came in search of an unusual experience, only made possible after the 2020 diplomatic agreements known as the Abraham Accords, normalizing Israel’s relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco.\n“There’s a deep sense here in the U.A.E. of it being like a social experiment, something that is very forward-looking and progressive,” said Ross Kriel, a South African constitutional lawyer who moved to Dubai from Johannesburg with his wife and children in 2013. He recalled the discreet life he had led there as an observant Jew before the Abraham Accords.\nCommunity leaders estimate the number of active members in Dubai’s Jewish community had grown over the last year from about 250 to 500 and it is expected to keep expanding quickly.\nThere are about seven locations holding weekly religious services in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the Emirati capital. At least five kosher restaurants have opened in the past year, and they are bustling almost every night. There is also a mikvah, or Jewish ritual bath for women.\n“We can walk the street with a kipa on, eat kosher, host lectures about Judaism and enter any place we want without any looks or comments,” said Elie Abadie, senior rabbi of the Jewish Council of the Emirates, an organization that acts as a bridge between Emirati officials and the Jewish community.\nCommunity leaders said more than 2,000 Jews celebrated Passover in Dubai this year at six hotels. More than 1,000 people attended one Seder alone.\nOver the past year, the Emirates welcomed Israeli officials and business delegations, announced a $10 billion fund aimed at investing in Israel, increased bilateral trade, received Jewish artists and musicians and opened its doors to more than 200,000 Israeli visitors.\nIn a region where many remain hostile to Israel because of its treatment of Palestinians, the bold overture is at once controversial and consequential, and some say hopeful.\nBefore the Abraham Accords, Mr. Kriel said, he would quietly plan his family vacations to Israel and host intimate Friday-night dinners with other observant Jews in his home. Years ago, he leased “Villa #11,” where he and about 20 others gathered quietly every weekend. It became a kind of community center.\n“It was the best kept secret in the Jewish world,” Mr. Kriel laughed, recalling how the first few Torah scrolls arrived in the country hidden in golf bags. “It’s hard to build a Jewish community and to feel comfortable as a Jew in a place if Israel isn’t recognized.”\nThat was at a time when Israelis could not travel to the Emirates unless they had dual citizenship and a second passport. But Jews from other countries, like the many other foreigners in Dubai, could live there safely and work without problems.\nSome of those early residents, who cautiously seeded the possibility of a religious and cultural life for Jews in the Emirates, are today steering the steady growth of the community.\nMr. Kriel now leads a regular service at the posh St. Regis Hotel on the Palm Jumeirah island in Dubai — a palm-shaped man-made island filled with mansions.\nIn late February, about 80 men, women and children boisterously trickled into a ballroom that had tables set up with religious books, spare skullcaps and a laminated, one-page prayer for the State of Israel. A company Mr. Kriel recently founded, called Kosher Arabia and which supplies kosher meals for Emirates Airline, catered the dinner.\n“We get to smash paradigms,” he said.\nBut critics say any dissent over the Jewish presence in Dubai is also smashed by the Emirati authorities.\nLong a hub for international commerce, the Emirates has a large and diverse Arab population including many Palestinians, who reject the 2020 normalization deals. But they risk arrest or expulsion if they try to express their opposition.\nNo one would dare criticize or speak up, said one Palestinian artist who was born and raised in the Emirates. She asked not to be named for fear of retribution.\nWhen the normalization agreement was announced, she said she drove to a mosque in Abu Dhabi, the Emirati capital, that was designed to resemble Jerusalem’s Dome of the Rock.\n“My anger zeroed in on the building,” she said. “I felt like there was a deceptiveness there, a desire to claim ownership of this Islamic icon while ignoring the Palestinians.”\nHer sentiments were echoed by others, including Egyptians and Jordanians, whose countries signed peace treaties with Israel long ago but remained reluctant to foster personal, civil or business ties with Israelis.\nBut some Arabs, including Emiratis in Dubai, expressed enthusiasm for change and a resounding sense of confidence in the country’s leadership, which they say has a proven record and a discerning vision of building a modern, strong and tolerant state.\n“We trust the government,” said Alanoud Alhashmi, 33, the chief executive and founder of The Futurist, a Dubai-based company that focuses on food security and agricultural technology — areas of concern and shared interest with Israel.\n“I get attacked for my opinion, but we need to start thinking about the future and forget the past,” added Ms. Alhashmi, who said she had met recently with Israeli businessmen. “There will be no such thing as a Palestinian cause if we run out of food and water.”\nMost Jews in the Emirates, like many Western expatriates, gravitate to Dubai, where unlike much of Arab world, modest dress is not necessary, alcohol is readily available and foreigners blend in easily.\nThere, they are laying the groundwork to support the community’s diverse and growing needs.\n“I would have never opened a Jewish nursery anywhere else in the world,” said Sonya Sellem, a French mother who owns Mini Miracles and an adjacent community center which is a hub for Jewish events.\nThe nursery enrolled its first group of about 20 children this year and plans to open two more classes next year. It also offers a Hebrew school for about 60 other children on Sundays.\n“Sure, there are people who are not happy,” Ms. Sellem said.\nNevertheless, she said she felt safer in Dubai than in London or Paris, where she saw antisemitism as more potent and palpable.\nRabbi Abadie, a Sephardic Jew who was born and raised in Lebanon before his family fled to Mexico in 1971, sat in one of several residential villas that the government had approved as places of worship for Jews. Hanging on one wall were framed portraits of the country’s ruling royals.\n“There hasn’t been a real Jewish presence in an Arab country, let alone building a new community,” he said, adding that this could change the entire face of the region.",

      "headline": "North Korea Holds Military Parade With Nuclear Threat",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/world/asia/north-korea-military-parade-kim.html",
      "text": "SEOUL — North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, vowed to expand his nuclear arsenal “at the fastest possible speed​” and threatened to use it, as his government displayed a large array of missiles and other weapons, including its newest intercontinental ballistic missile, during a nighttime military parade on Monday, the North’s state media said.\nWith his defiant tone, Mr. Kim ​appeared to raise the stakes in ​the stalled international efforts ​to curtail his nuclear weapons ambition. North Korea’s growing nuclear and missile threat ​will probably be one of the most pressing diplomatic issues discussed during an expected meeting next month between President Biden and South Korea’s president​-elect​,​ Yoon Suk-yeol.\n​Mr. Yoon, who takes office on May 10, has said he will align South Korea’s policy on North Korea closer to that of Washington’s by reinvigorating sanctions enforcement on the North. He is expected to meet with Mr. Biden in Seoul after his inauguration and before Mr. Biden travels on to Japan to attend a regional security forum.\n“The nuclear forces, the symbol of our national strength and the core of our military power, should be strengthened in terms of both quality and scale,” Mr. Kim said in a speech he delivered during a large parade in Pyongyang, the capital, on Monday night to mark an important military anniversary, according to the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.\nMr. Kim said that although North Korea has built its nuclear weapons as a deterrent, “our nukes can never be confined to the single mission of war deterrent.”\n“If any forces try to violate the fundamental interests of our state, our nuclear forces will have to decisively accomplish its unexpected second mission,” he said.\nIn recent weeks, North Korea has raised the possibility of using nuclear weapons should war break out on the Korean Peninsula. During his election campaign, Mr. Yoon said South Korea would consider “pre-emptive ​strikes” against the North’s nuclear forces if the South were under nuclear threat.\nNorth Korea has since warned that it could use nuclear weapons ​during a conflict. This month, North Korea reported a successful test of a new missile that it said would significantly enhance its short-range tactical nuclear capabilities​. Such capabilities — along with nuclear-armed Russia’s invasion of the non-nuclear state Ukraine — have increased South Korean fears over Mr. Kim’s nuclear program.\nMr. Kim has staged a dozen military parades since he took power a decade ago, using the events to boost the morale of his people, long suffering under international sanctions, and to display his nuclear arsenal, which is his single biggest achievement as leader. The parades are monitored closely by outside analysts and officials because Mr. Kim has often used them to ​show off his new ​weapons.\nOn display during the parade on Monday night ​was the Hwasong-17​, the North’s newest and largest ICBM​, according to photos released through North Korean news media​. ​Mr. Kim appeared in his white military marshal’s uniform bedecked with golden buttons and epaulets.\n“It’s unusual for Kim Jong-un to deliver a speech during a parade in his marshal’s uniform,” said Cheong Seong-chang, director of the Center for North Korean Studies at the Sejong Institute, a research think tank in South Korea. “This signals an extremely hard-line stance he will likely adopt toward the incoming South Korean government of Yoon Suk-yeol, who has voiced a hawkish stance toward the North.”​\nDuring his speech, Mr. Kim exhorted his people to brace themselves for a confrontation with their external enemies “for a long period of time.” The parade also featured military jets flying in formation, neat columns of goose-stepping or horse-riding soldiers, as well as a host of ​new ​weapons North Korea has been developing or testing in recent years, including submarine-launched ballistic missiles​ and hypersonic missiles.\nNorth Korea has conducted a spate of missile tests in recent months, including an ICBM test on March 24. ​The country claimed to have launched its Hwasong-17 in the March test, but South Korean officials have ​since ​suspected that ​the North actually launched its older Hwasong-15 because ​of technical glitches in the ​Hwasong-17.​\nSeoul and Washington have hoped to bring Mr. Kim back to the negotiating table, but the military parade was a strong indication that diplomacy will not happen quickly, analysts said.\nIn 2017, North Korea detonated what it called a hydrogen bomb​ in an underground nuclear test and ​tested three ICBMs​, including the Hwasong-15​. Those tests led to harsher sanctions from the United Nations. ​Mr. Kim ​declared a moratorium on ​all ​ICBM ​and nuclear tests before ​embarking on summit meetings with President Donald J. Trump in 2018.​ Through his negotiations with ​Mr. Trump, Mr. Kim had hoped to lift the sanctions in exchange for a partial dismantling of his nuclear program.\nBut ​his meetings with Mr. Trump ended ​in 2019 ​without an agreement on when to lift the sanctions or how to roll back the North’s nuclear and missile programs. Mr. Kim has since apologized to his people for the economic woes caused by the sanctions and the pandemic. ​But he has also ​escalated his nuclear and missile programs.\nWith the ​Hwasong test last month, North Korea lifted ​the moratorium on ICBM tests. This month, images taken by commercial satellites indicated that North Korea might be reconstructing its underground nuclear test site​, which the North had partly destroyed in 2018 ahead of Mr. Kim’s first summit with Mr. Trump. The activities there have raised fears that​ the North might be preparing to resume nuclear tests as well.\nNorth Korea’s recent missile tests and other weapons-related activities have been part of an effort by Mr. Kim to advance his nuclear capabilities and to pressure Washington to return to the negotiating table with sanctions relief and other concessions, analysts say. The war in Ukraine has also created a favorable environment for Mr. Kim to push forward the North’s weapons programs, as Russia and China were likely to block any American attempt to impose fresh sanctions at the United Nations Security Council.",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/europe/france-cartoons-presidential-election.html",
      "text": "PARIS — There is little time left until the French choose their next president on Sunday, and image is important. As media teams flutter around the two remaining candidates, President Emmanuel Macron and the far-right leader Marine Le Pen, the nation’s political cartoonists are out in force, ready to accentuate even the smallest slip.\nWhen they pounce, many will be waiting in a country where political cartoons have deep roots, thriving as expressions of unhappiness during the French Revolution and continuing to play an outsize role in modern-day politics.\nComic books regularly top the French best-seller lists, and weekly satirical newspapers — most notably Charlie Hebdo and Le Canard Enchaîné — are considered national institutions. Last year, when Mr. Macron’s government granted teenagers 300 euros (about $325) to spend on culture, many bought comic books.\n“The world of politics is very artificial,” said Mathieu Sapin, a cartoonist behind several comic books featuring Mr. Macron and his predecessor, François Hollande. “It’s very codified, which makes it deeply fascinating from a drawing perspective.”\nFor Mr. Sapin, the French president is a character of fascination. He is often depicted by cartoonists as a gaptoothed, square-shouldered, somewhat boyish figure. But he also remains aloof, granting significantly less access than did Mr. Hollande, who courted cartoonists as much as journalists.\n“Macron is more distant with the media, though he did once come up to me to tell me how much he loved cartoons,” recalled Mr. Sapin. “He’s a real seducer.”\nHow much so was illustrated in Mr. Sapin’s previous book, “Comédie Française,” in 2017. In one cartoon, the two men shake hands. A bead of sweat appears on Sapin’s forehead. “This handshake is taking a long time,” reads the thought bubble.\nMr. Sapin is drawing Mr. Macron for “Campaign Notebooks,” his 240-page comic book on the 2022 presidential election. The project brings together Mr. Sapin and five other veteran cartoonists: Dorothée de Monfreid, Kokopello, Louison, Morgan Navarro and Lara.\nEach cartoonist was assigned one or two candidates to follow for the course of the campaign — most of whom were eliminated in the first round on April 10. For eight months, they traveled the breadth of the country, attending rallies and meetings, and even tagging along on trips overseas.\nThe team has worked independently, occasionally meeting in Mr. Sapin’s studio to plot on a big dry-erase board. “We are all recounting different events, but it’s all rendered in the same way,” said Louison, who goes by one name. For her, the small details are the most compelling.\n“Political gaffes, the sight of an aide frantically helping a politician with their tie before a speech, backstage pep talks and spats — these make the comics,” said Louison, who followed Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, during her unsuccessful campaign, joining her on bike rides around the city.\nBeyond being used as a tool for revolt, political cartoons have long been used as an ideological weapon — Communists and radically conservative Catholic groups in France used cartoons to influence the country’s youth after World War II — and their importance is not lost on Mr. Macron.\nHe gave the keynote speech two years ago at the International Comics Festival in Angoulême, the first presidential visit since François Mitterrand attended the event in 1985, and he announced plans for a European House of Press and Satirical Cartoons to open in the capital by 2025.\n“Still,” said Mr. Sapin, “he wants to protect his image.”\nHis rival, Ms. Le Pen, is often drawn as a self-congratulatory figure, her mop of yellow hair and twinkling blue gaze emphasized. Mr. Navarro has chosen to home in on what he sees as a smug air, representing Ms. Le Pen with spiky, upturned features and eyes narrowed in steely determination. \nMr. Navarro has noticed some of her subtler tics, too, such as the nervous puffing on an e-cigarette, or the readjusting of a particular strand of hair. These he has worked into his drawings for humorous effect, but also a degree of pathos — something not usually associated with a far-right politician who was once depicted on the cover of Charlie Hebdo dressed in a dirndl and holding a gun to Europe’s head.\nWhile in Marseille, Mr. Navarro was startled by the sight of Ms. Le Pen, whose message is fiercely anti-immigrant, posing for a selfie with a group of Muslim men, a moment he captured for the book. “Her image has changed, somewhat — they seemed unfazed by her reputation,” Mr. Navarro said.\nThe sequential structure of a cartoon strip is well suited to politics, but as the team learned in the case of the far-right candidate Éric Zemmour, not everything goes as planned.\nIn the early days of the campaign, Mr. Zemmour was “a joke,” Mr. Sapin said, and the team didn’t even bother to assign anyone to cover him. “But then in the autumn he became a serious candidate, and we had to adapt.”\nWith his eccentric mannerisms and caterpillar eyebrows, Mr. Zemmour was easy prey for cartoonists — attracting comparisons to Gargamel, the villain from the Smurfs. But Mr. Navarro noticed something else: “I was surprised by how many young people were among his supporters, they seemed really fired up.”\n“In the newspapers he often comes across as a caricature,” Mr. Navarro said. “But what we’re doing here is showing the context of events — not just caricaturing each candidate.”\nBringing the different campaigns together in a book affords unusual insights into strategy. Were the candidates playing the long game? Did their approaches remain the same throughout?\n“And it also shows just how long they’ve all been working up to this moment,” said Kokopello, who also goes by one name and drew Valérie Pécresse, the now-eliminated, center-right Republican candidate. “Many people seem to think the campaigns started just a couple of months ago, but it’s been much longer.”\nAlong with the election’s twists and turns, the book chronicles the shifting national mood: In the opening pages, the pandemic dominates the narrative, face masks slowly fading from view; the emergence of surprise candidates, the failure of early hopefuls; Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February.\n“We are recording how things played out, in real time,” Mr. Sapin said.\nThe last 12 pages are still blank, awaiting a final result that will likely be close. “Anything can happen — that’s what makes it so thrilling.”",

      "headline": "Star Ferry, ‘Emblem of Hong Kong,’ May Sail Into History After 142 Years",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/asia/hong-kong-star-ferry.html",
      "text": "HONG KONG — On a damp Monday morning in Hong Kong, Freeman Ng looked out from the upper deck of the Star Ferry as it approached land. A sailor tossed a heavy rope to a colleague on the pier, who looped it around a bollard as the swoosh of the waves crashed against the green and white vessel pulling in from Victoria Harbor.\nMr. Ng, 43, commutes from Kowloon to Hong Kong Island on the ferry most weekdays. The subway would be much faster, but Mr. Ng prefers to cross the harbor by boat. “The feeling is better on the ferry,” he said, taking in the salt air.\nHong Kong has had many casualties over the last three years. Mass social unrest in 2019 scared off tourists and hit restaurateurs and hoteliers. Coronavirus restrictions wiped out thousands of mom-and-pop shops. But the prospect of losing the Star Ferry — a 142-year-old institution — has resonated differently.\nSince the pandemic began, the crowds that Mr. Ng once jostled to squeeze onto the ferry gangplank are gone. There are now so few passengers that the company that owns Star Ferry says the service may soon end, dimming the life of the harbor and the city itself.\n“It has so much history,” said Chan Tsz Ho, a 24-year-old assistant coxswain. “In the minds of Hong Kong people, including me, it’s an emblem of Hong Kong.”\nLike Hong Kong, the Star Ferry once represented a link between the East and the West. It was the first scheduled public ferry service in 1880 to connect Hong Kong Island to the Kowloon Peninsula, and the Chinese territory beyond it. Its founder, a Parsi baker and businessman, arrived in the city from Mumbai decades earlier as a stowaway on a ship headed to China.\nAt the time of his arrival, Hong Kong, only recently colonized by the British, was already transforming into a boomtown with corruption, drugs and disease on land and piracy and smuggling on the water. A police force made up of European, Chinese and South Asian officers tried to keep order.\nDorabjee Naorojee Mithaiwala, the ferry’s founder, named his first four vessels Morning Star, Evening Star, Rising Star and Guiding Star. The current fleet includes eight boats that have changed little in the six decades since they were built. All eight have a star in their name.\nThe Star Ferry grew to become part of the lifeblood of Hong Kong. Residents were so dependent on it that a government-approved fare increase in 1966 led to days of protests, a harbinger of social unrest that spilled over into deadly demonstrations and riots a year later. British officials eventually responded with policy reforms.\nThe Star Ferry riots came to symbolize the power of protest in Hong Kong, but as the ferry jolted across the harbor on a recent trip, with sailors pulling a chain to lower a red and yellow gangplank, that history appeared unremarkable to the scattered passengers trickling off the boat.\nIssac Chan’s first memory of the Star Ferry was five decades ago, when his parents took him for an adventure as a young boy. “It traveled slow, but it was enjoyable. It wasn’t easy to go on a boat on the sea,” he said. Mr. Chan, 58, grew up in the New Territories, near the border with mainland China.\nThese days, he takes the ferry each morning after his shift as a night security guard in a residential building on Old Peak Road, a well-heeled area where Chinese people were unable to own property for part of British rule. The ride gives him time to unwind at the end of his work day, he said.\nWhen the British handed Hong Kong over to China in 1997, some who had fled to Hong Kong from China during the Cultural Revolution and, later, the bloody crackdown of Tiananmen Square in 1989 feared they would have to flee once again. Instead, life went on and little seemed to change for decades. Hong Kong continued to thrive as a hub for international finance and as a stopover for travelers in Asia.\nAfter the city built a cross harbor tunnel in 1972, other forms of public transport offered faster trips, and the ferry began to rely more on foreign visitors hopping on the boat for a cheap tour of the city. Commuters and touring passengers with cameras around their necks sometimes sat cheek by jowl, taking in the sights of flashing neon billboards, junk boats and shard-like skyscrapers rising toward Victoria Peak.\nYet the Star Ferry would once again witness upheaval.\nIn 2019, confrontations in Hong Kong between pro-democracy protesters and riot police officers were broadcast around the world. Protesters carrying helmets and protective goggles made their way to demonstrations to demand political freedom from China. Streets once crowded with tourists were shrouded in tear gas.\nThe confrontations brought on a fierce crackdown from Beijing and marked the beginning of the Star Ferry’s recent financial troubles: The company says that it has lost more money in the 30 months since the protests erupted than it made over the last three decades. Even though the ferries can still be crowded at certain times of the day, especially when the weather is nice, the overall passenger numbers are far below what they were three years ago.\n“The company is bleeding hard and we definitely need to find our way out,” said David Chow Cheuk-yin, the general manager. Mr. Chow has appealed to the public through media appearances, hoping that a cry for help will resonate with a deep-pocketed investor in a city built by business tycoons.\nWhen he was asked to take over running the Star Ferry late last year, things were looking up, Mr. Chow said. Hong Kong had declared victory over the virus. Small businesses nearly destroyed by pandemic restrictions that had mostly cut Hong Kong off from the rest of the world began making plans to fully reopen. Some lawmakers even discussed loosening border controls.\n“We were talking about recovery when I first took up this role,” Mr. Chow said.\nThen Omicron broke through Hong Kong’s fortress walls, forcing restaurants, bars, gyms and schools to close. “Instead of recovery, we are talking about survival mode,” said Mr. Chow. “Everything changed so quickly.”\nFor Mr. Chan, the assistant coxswain, being a seaman is a time-honored family tradition. His father, also a Star Ferry sailor, regaled him with stories of the sea as a young boy. His grandfather, a fisherman, also shared tales. So when there was an opening for a trainee position at Star Ferry three years ago, Mr. Chan jumped.\nThe baby-faced boatman, who stands out among the weathered older sailors at Star Ferry, said he would spend the rest of his life on the water if given the chance. His favorite part of the job is navigating the whims of the currents and steering the ferries in challenging weather, carving out different paths each time, he said.\nWhen the fog hangs over the water, hindering visibility in the crowded harbor, he and the crew have to use their ears as well as their eyes to navigate. “You can’t even see the other end of your own vessel,” he said.\nMr. Chan’s young face betrayed a hint of disappointment as he started to explain that his morning shift begins an hour later now because the ferry has reduced its hours. For much of this year it had stopped running two hours earlier at night, too. The sounds of passengers flipping the ferry’s wooden seats are muted.\n“Sometimes there is only one or two passengers crossing the harbor,” Mr. Chan said, “but we are a full crew.”",

      "text": "The director general of the World Health Organization arrived in India on Monday for a visit that comes amid a dispute over India’s Covid-19 death count.\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is on a three-day trip to India, where he is scheduled to take part in events with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Gujarat, the Indian leader’s home state.\nThe New York Times reported last week that Indian officials were delaying the public release of a report by the W.H.O. that found the global death toll of Covid-19 was about 15 million by the end of 2021, more than double the official total of six million reported by countries individually. More than a third of the additional nine million deaths are estimated to have occurred in India, where the government stood by its own count of about 520,000.\nThe Indian government said in a statement over the weekend in response to the article that it had concerns it has shared with the W.H.O. in formal letters and meetings about the organization’s methodology. “India’s basic objection has not been with the result (whatever they might have been) but rather the methodology adopted for the same,” the federal health ministry said.\nDr. Tedros did not comment directly on the dispute, but he is expected to bring it up with Indian health officials.\nOn Tuesday, the W.H.O. leader participated in a ceremony to mark the beginning of construction for a traditional medicine center established by the organization and the Indian government.\nThe center would “help to harness the power of science to strengthen evidence-based traditional medicine,” Dr. Tedros said at the ceremony, adding: “This is truly a global project.”\nThe W.H.O. says it aims to build evidence for the use of traditional medicine practices to help “countries integrate it as appropriate into their health systems and regulate its quality and safety for optimal and sustainable impact.”",

      "text": "After two years of working from home during the pandemic, and plenty of false starts, employees are officially heading back to work as the R.T.O., or return to office, is in full swing.\nRoughly 60 percent of U.S. workers who could work from home were still signing in remotely as of January, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center, as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus set back R.T.O. plans. But now companies like Google are insisting that their workers return to the office on hybrid work schedules.\nFor many workers, the commuter train has already left the station. And after controlling our own environment at home, returning to work means we’ll be faced with annoying behaviors among our colleagues again: loud talkers, nosy cubicle mates, the olfactory emanations of the shared microwave.\nHow do we confront these people — and how do we check our emotions, which may be in overdrive after working in relative isolation, to keep ourselves from snapping?\nConsider this a fresh start for everybody, said Darian Lewis, who, with his wife, Monica, founded the Monica Lewis School of Etiquette in Houston. “You know all those things you wanted to change in your workplace prior to the pandemic, but you just couldn’t figure out how to do it?” he said. “Well, seize the opportunity right now.”\nLindsey Pollack, a workplace expert and the author of “Recalculating: Navigate Your Career Through the Changing World of Work,” said there are three things to keep in mind when you’re getting back in the groove. “Acknowledge that we are out of shape dealing with other people,” she said. “Lower your expectations and assume that you’re going to have some annoyances. And really give thought to the new habits that you want to create from Day 1, and be deliberate about making changes now.”\nAnd before you fume that, once again, Bob is leaving his unwashed mug in the break room sink for someone else to deal with, check yourself, said Sozan Miglioli, a Zen Buddhist priest and president of the San Francisco Zen Center.\n“There’s actually a big difference between responding and reaction,” Mr. Miglioli said. “What I do is pause, breathe and connect with the present moment.”\nThat pause will give you a chance to choose your battles, said Dr. Jody J. Foster, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of “The Schmuck in My Office: How to Deal Effectively With Difficult People at Work.”\n“Ask yourself, ‘Is this a battle I need to have because it’s truly getting in the way of my work, or am I just being crispy because I’m so used to being alone during the pandemic and having everything the exact way I wanted it?’” she said.\nHere’s how to deal quickly and effectively with some of the most irritating workplace habits.",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/europe/mariupol-azovstal-steel-plant.html",
      "text": "DNIPRO, Ukraine — Under incessant fire from the air and with Russian troops closing in, a group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the besieged city of Mariupol issued a message of despair on Tuesday evening, expressing hope that their own forces would come to their rescue and demanding that the world do something to stop the Kremlin’s vicious war.\n“We’re surrounded; they’re bombing us with everything they can,” said a Ukrainian soldier who gave his name as Gasim. “Our only plan is for the blockade to be broken by our forces so that we can get out of here.”\nGasim and his comrades reached out to a reporter near midnight as Russian forces continued their bombardment of a sprawling Soviet-era steel mill with underground bunkers that is sheltering thousands of soldiers and civilians. \nWhile Gasim and the others would not confirm that they were in the mill, the Azovstal steel plant, officials said that this was where the last Ukrainian defenders of Mariupol had taken refuge as Russia’s battle to take full control of the city appeared to be entering its final stages.\nThe soldiers spoke by video chat on WhatsApp, offering a rare glimpse of a battlefield that has transfixed the world. The men often spoke over one another, the light of the phone occasionally bringing their faces into focus in the otherwise pitch-black darkness. They seemed unaware of the attention their fight had attracted and refused to divulge basic details about the number of troops and their locations that the Ukrainian authorities had already described.\n\nThe holdouts in the underground fortress represent the last stand of a strategic city that has endured a relentless siege by Russian forces. The remaining defenders’ ordeal has captured global attention as they have held off the enemy for weeks, in what has been likened to a Ukrainian Alamo.\nWith ammunition and supplies sparse, the men who were interviewed said they were carrying on the fight and refusing to acquiesce to the Kremlin’s demand’s for capitulation. But they acknowledged that they were running out of time and increasingly found it difficult to leave the protection of their shelter because of the heavy bombing.\n“We are putting up a difficult fight with the enemy, protecting our country and our people and our culture, our right to self-determination,” another soldier who gave his name as Kostya said, even as he acknowledged they had little to fight with.\n“As we’re talking to you, they’re firing on us from the air, dropping bombs,” Gasim said. “Tell America to help us.”\nAfter about 15 minutes, the video cut out and further attempts to reach the men were unsuccessful.\nThe interviews came as Russian forces bombarded the plant with a heavy barrage of airstrikes and mortar rounds, as well as naval artillery fire from ships on the Sea of Azov.\nThe Azovstal plant where the men are likely sheltered makes for a formidable fortress, an immense industrial complex of thick concrete and walls, steel doors and reinforced underground warrens. Yan Gagin, who identified himself as a Russian adviser in the Donetsk People’s Republic, a self-declared government in eastern Ukraine backed by the Kremlin, said in a broadcast report that the steel factory was designed to withstand a nuclear war.\n“It is basically a city under a city,” he said, conceding that the Russian campaign to seize the plant had been significantly hampered by the sophisticated network of passages, rooms and communication systems connecting the basement levels of the plant.\nFrederick W. Kagan, director of the Critical Threats project at the American Enterprise Institute, said, “I assume the Russians are going to throw everything they have at this, to eliminate this pocket,” but he added that doing so could cost them dearly. “You’d be surprised at how well people can survive big bombs in a facility like that,” he said.\nA spokeswoman for Metinvest, the company that owns the mill, said that the bunkers beneath it were used as shelters by steelworkers in 2014, when Russian-backed separatists tried to seize Mariupol.\n“Ever since the first invasion, we’ve kept the bunkers in good order and supplied with food and water,” said Galina Yatsura, who heads international communications for Metinvest, adding that the shelters can house up to 4,000 people and are stocked with enough food and water to last three weeks.\nTwo employees who stayed at the plant in the early days of the siege said that more than 2,000 civilians had been staying there, many of them family members of employees.\nRussia’s Defense Ministry called a cease-fire for Wednesday in the area of the plant to allow civilians to leave, the Russian state news media reported. However, previous attempts to suspend fighting have fallen through.\nThe plant stretches across four square miles, a complex of buildings, smokestacks, blast furnaces and stacks of coiled and plate steel, and it has its own port facilities on the Sea of Azov.\nOne of the largest metal mills in Europe, it produced about 4.3 million tons of steel annually before the Russian invasion, according to Metinvest, a steel and mining conglomerate owned by Ukraine’s richest man, the billionaire Rinat Akhmetov.\nThe network of underground passages and rooms, which is now pivotal to the survival of the holed-up soldiers and civilians, was originally built to transport equipment between buildings, according to Metinvest. There was no planned military use for the tunnels before the war, the company said.\nThe steel mill has been under heavy bombardment, a Ukrainian commander, Lt. Col. Denys Prokopenko, said Monday in a video recorded at the factory. “They use free-fall bombs, rockets, bunker-buster bombs, all varieties of artillery, both ground and naval for indiscriminate attacks,” he said.\nThe Russians are trying to establish uncontested control of territory linking the separatist-held regions of Donbas, in southeastern Ukraine, to the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia seized in 2014. The holdouts in Mariupol are the last substantial obstacle left in the region.\nRussian forces have had the city, a major port, under siege since last month, bombarding much of it to rubble and slowly tightening their grip.\nThe fight over the Azovstal steel plant recalls one of the great struggles of the Second World War, the battle for the Stalingrad Tractor Factory as Nazi Germany’s forces attempted to capture that city. Thousands of German and Soviet soldiers died there, as did many civilians, before the Soviets ultimately prevailed.\n“We’ve seen this movie before,” Mr. Kagan said. “Anytime you’re dealing with a sprawling, heavy industrial complex, it’s going to make a good fighting position for defenders.”\nUkraine’s intelligence service wrote in a statement on Monday that the Russians were preparing to use three-ton bombs on the plant in an effort to raze it completely. Moscow is “not deterred by the fact that civilians have taken refuge in the plant,” the service said in a statement.\nThe plant was first established by the Soviet Union in the 1930s and rebuilt following World War II. It is a labyrinth of rail systems, workshops, blast furnaces and warehouses, with many of the buildings made of thick concrete and designed to withstand high temperatures.\nIf Russia succeeds in flattening the complex’s buildings, it is not clear how many people hunkered underground might survive. Eventually, though, they would run out of provisions, and the Ukrainians have warned repeatedly that the Russians might use chemical weapons to force them out or kill them.\nIn the confusion of the siege, it was difficult to get a clear picture of what was happening inside the factory. But according to Ms. Yatsura, a number of employees remain there. They had stayed after the invasion began to prepare the complex’s bomb shelters and eliminate hazardous materials.\nClearing the plant could hold particular symbolic value for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who has justified his invasion with the false claim that Ukraine is run by Nazis, and that he is rooting them out. The plant’s defenders include members of the Azov Battalion, a force that does include far-right soldiers, some of them foreign, including white supremacists and people who have been described as fascists.\nCapturing the Azovstal plant would also give the Russians better access to the region’s railway system and seaport.\nHow long the Ukrainian defenders can stave off the Russian invaders there will depend in large part on how many people are inside and how well sustained they are. Pyotr Andryushchenko, an aide to Mayor Vadym Boychenko of Mariupol, said the Ukrainian Army had arranged two operations over the past two weeks to take food to the plant; he did not say how that was accomplished. But the situation will probably grow more dire, he said, as Russian troops have blocked anyone, including civilians, from entering or leaving the city.\n“These people, many wanted to avoid being displaced or deported, so they found protection with our troops, in the basement of the plant,” said Mr. Andryushchenko, who, like the mayor, left the city weeks ago.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said on Sunday that its forces had completely surrounded the steel plant, and that the Ukrainian forces holding out “forbade negotiations about surrendering,” citing an intercepted radio transmission.",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/europe/russia-ukraine-donbas-strategy.html",
      "text": "KHARKIV, Ukraine — Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine in February relied on a rapid advance of tanks and helicopter assaults deep into the country — two strategies that ultimately failed and cost Moscow a significant number of casualties.\nNow, Russia has launched a new campaign with a narrower goal focused primarily on capturing Ukraine’s east, and it promises to be much more methodical, according to Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\nInstead of lightning attacks from the Russian front lines, Moscow’s forces — arrayed in a semicircle that stretches west to east from the city of Izium to Sieverodonetsk — have increased their artillery barrages and sent small detachments of troops to probe Ukrainian lines. Many of the Ukrainian troops that are in this region, known as the Donbas, are entrenched in earthworks that have been there for the better part of a decade.\nKnown as “shaping operations” in military circles, these smaller Russian attacks are often precursors to larger troop movements, or serve as a distraction from other fronts. In the past several days the Russians have sent around 11 more battalion tactical groups into the Donbas, bringing the number there to around 75, according to Pentagon officials. Each group has roughly a thousand troops.\nWhile there have not yet been any large offensives, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense said in a statement Tuesday that Russian forces are laying the groundwork for a future push: more surface-to-air missile systems have been shuttled to the front to protect important positions and more artillery positions have appeared. \nAt this point in the war, it is clear that long-range weapons that can fire out of sight of their targets, such as howitzers and multiple launch rocket systems, have proven to be important when it comes holding and taking territory.\nSo far, Russia’s new campaign in the Donbas appears to rely heavily on those weapons, as does Ukraine’s defense. \nIn Horlivka, a city occupied by Russian-backed separatists, one resident said on Tuesday that, after a week of quiet, there was heavy artillery fire coming from the Russian side, along with troop movements and Russian jets flying overhead.\nThere were strikes across Ukraine over the last several days signaling a new escalation: In Kharkiv, for instance, Russian artillery slammed into a frequently shelled residential area on Tuesday, killing at least three people. The lethal strike comes on the heels of two days of blistering rocket and artillery attacks into parts of the city that have been rarely hit in the past month.\nOther cities like Zaporizhzhia, Lviv and Kyiv, the capital, were hit with cruise missiles and artillery fire as Russian forces prepared ground troops for their thrust in the Donbas, an industrial heartland in the east the size of New Hampshire with a front line that stretches hundreds of miles.\nOne resident in Kramatorsk — an eastern city still in Ukrainian hands that is likely to be one of Russia’s main targets in the offensive — said he watched from a vantage point in recent days as the front line to the northwest of the city erupted in concentrated artillery barrages.\nUkraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in a video Monday night that Russian forces had started the battle for the Donbas. “A very significant part of the Russian Army is now concentrated for that offensive,” he said.\nThe two sides have been locked in a battle over the Donbas region for the last eight years, with Ukrainian government forces fighting Russian-backed separatists. \nThe coming battle, on wide-open terrain, will look significantly different from the urban warfare that took place around Kyiv, where the Russian military tried and failed to take the capital. \n“Compared to the first few weeks of the war, this next offensive is a lot less decisive than it may seem,” said Michael Kofman, the director of Russian studies at CNA, a research institute in Arlington, Va. “No matter what happens in the Donbas, the costs are likely to be so high that the Russian military will be a spent force.”\nRussia’s battlefield failures have cost Moscow dearly so far. The number of Russian losses in the war so far remains unknown, though Western intelligence agencies estimate 7,000 to 10,000 killed and 20,000 to 30,000 wounded. Thousands more have been captured or are missing in action.\nUkraine’s losses have also been steep, though the government has declined to offer specific figures even to American officials. U.S. intelligence agencies estimate 5,500 to 11,000 killed and more than 18,000 wounded, but the wide range indicates the uncertainty in the figures.\nWhile Russian forces are probing Ukrainian front lines and putting forces into position in the northern reaches of Donbas, the fight in the south — around the city of Mariupol — has turned into a full-blown siege, with the encircled Ukrainian defenders there barely holding out in an aging Soviet-era steel and iron plant. Thousands of civilians have been wounded or killed in the monthlong battle, according to Ukrainian officials. And others remain trapped.\nSvitlana Grebinyk, 46, said she last heard from her son, a Ukrainian marine in Mariupol, on April 12. He had sent a message to her daughter on Instagram.\nShe paraphrased him: “I don’t have a way out. We have no other choice. We will most likely be in captivity.”\n“I love you all.”\nHer son’s unit, the 36th Brigade, had posted a message on its Facebook page on April 11. Ms. Grebinyk ignored it because it was fraught with grammatical errors and in Russian and Ukrainian, and she thought it was disinformation. \nIt turned out it was a farewell note from the brigade. “It ended very very sadly,” she said, “With ‘I don’t know what’s going to come next but please remember our brigade and that we did everything. We were loyal forever.’”\nCapturing Mariupol is a key part of the Russian campaign in Ukraine’s east. The city’s fall would allow Russia to complete a land bridge between Russian-held territory and occupied Crimea. \nIt would also allow Russian forces to regroup and then push north to Ukrainian positions around the city of Zaporizhzhia. This could enable them to put added pressure on Ukrainian troops defending Donbas from the north and the south, stressing supply lines and other resources.\nTetiana Plysenko, 61, a resident of Huliaipole, one of the towns north of Mariupol that is on the front line, said little had changed in the last few days. The shelling continues unabated, though on Saturday there was an airstrike near the town — a rarity, another resident of the town said.\n“Some people,” Ms. Plysenko said, “have come back and tended their gardens recently.”\nUkrainian forces have responded in kind to the Russian escalation, firing their own artillery — a mixture of howitzers, mortars and unguided rockets — to disrupt and delay any larger attack.\nBut despite new supplies and commitments from the United States and other NATO countries, Ukrainian officials continue to voice deep concerns about their own supply of ammunition and whether it will be sufficient to keep the advancing Russian forces at bay.",

      "headline": "More Cautious, Russia Embarks on New Phase of Ukraine War",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/ukraine-russia-donbas-offensive.html",
      "text": "KHARKIV, Ukraine — Russia plunged into a new chapter of the Ukraine war on Tuesday, intent on capturing the eastern part of the country and crushing Ukrainian defenses without the same blunders that badly damaged Russian forces in the conflict’s initial weeks.\n“Another phase of this operation is starting now,” Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia said, as the Russian Defense Ministry announced that its missile and artillery forces had struck hundreds of Ukrainian military targets overnight.\nThe strikes mainly hit the eastern region known as Donbas, Ukraine’s industrial heartland, where pro-Moscow separatists have battled Ukrainian forces since Russia seized Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula in 2014.\nThe Donbas has now become the stated territorial objective of Russia’s redeployed invasion force along a front that stretches roughly 300 miles, from an area near the northern city of Kharkiv to the besieged southern port of Mariupol, where die-hard Ukrainian defenders ensconced in a sprawling steel plant have repeatedly defied Russian demands to surrender.\nUkraine’s military said that its forces had repulsed seven different Russian thrusts along the front on Tuesday, destroying 10 tanks and 18 armored units in the battles. The claims of both militaries could not be independently verified.\nDespite Russian warnings, Ukraine’s Western supporters, led by the United States, are now rushing to send longer-range weapons including howitzers, antiaircraft systems, anti-ship missiles, armed drones and even tanks — arms that American officials said were designed to thwart the Russian offensive.\nWestern military experts said the offensive promised to be much more methodical than the blitz-like operation the Kremlin launched Feb. 24 to subjugate Ukraine, which was marked by rapid and ultimately unsuccessful advances of tanks and helicopter assaults deep inside the former Soviet republic.\nThat miscalculation was compounded by flawed logistics, poor soldier morale, an unexpectedly tenacious Ukrainian resistance and Western-supplied weapons used to devastating effect on Russian armored vehicles, upending Russia’s hopes for a quick victory and forcing its military to retreat and regroup.\nNow, instead of lightning attacks from the Russian front lines, Moscow’s forces, focusing on taking the Donbas, have increased their long-range artillery barrages and sent small detachments of troops to probe Ukrainian defenders, many entrenched in earthworks established during the Moscow-backed insurgency in the eastern region that began eight years ago.\nThe Pentagon estimated that Russia now has about 75 battalion tactical groups in Ukraine, each with roughly 1,000 troops. It also has tens of thousands more troops in reserve north of Ukraine who are being resupplied and readied to join the fight, U.S. officials said.\nBut the underlying weaknesses in Russia’s invasion force that have been exposed so far in the conflict have not necessarily gone away, military analysts said. And even with a more deliberate and cautious approach by Russia and its bigger, more powerful army, they said, the outcome in Ukraine remains unclear at best.\nSome American military specialists said the Russian reinforcements pouring in — including Russian mercenaries, conscripts and regular troops pulled from the country’s far east and Georgia — are deficient. They have not trained together and their combat readiness is low, officials said.\nMoreover, it will take time to regroup and redeploy the battered units that retreated from the north. Some will be replenished and sent back to the fight. But others are so spent that their remaining pieces will be patched together into one new unit with commanders hoping for the best in battle.\nAs these Russian forces push west to seize more territory, they will extend their supply lines and could confront the same logistics shortfalls that bedeviled them before.\n“The vehicles are still poorly maintained, troop morale will remain low,” said Maj. Gen. Michael S. Repass, a former commander of U.S. Special Operations forces in Europe who has been involved with Ukrainian defense matters since 2016.\n“The outcome hinges on who can reconstitute effective forces faster than the other,” General Repass said. “Fresh faces from elsewhere in Russia aren’t going to be much use as replacements unless they are combat ready when they show up.”\nRussia’s battlefield mistakes have cost Moscow dearly so far. The number of Russian military losses in the war so far remains unknown, though Western intelligence agencies estimate 7,000 to 10,000 killed and 20,000 to 30,000 wounded. Thousands more have been captured or are missing.\nOutgunned and outnumbered, Ukraine has also had steep military losses, though the government has declined to offer specific figures even to American officials. U.S. intelligence agencies estimate 5,500 to 11,000 killed and more than 18,000 wounded, but the wide range indicates the uncertainty in the figures.\nPunctuated by Russia’s indiscriminate aerial bombardments, the invasion has left thousands of civilians dead or wounded, caused Europe’s worst refugee crisis since World War II, deeply isolated Russia economically because of Western sanctions and turned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia into a pariah who has been described as a war criminal in the United States and Europe.\nWhile there have not yet been any large offensives in the Donbas region, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense said in a statement Tuesday that Russian forces were laying the groundwork for a future push: more surface-to-air missile systems have been shuttled to the front to protect important positions and more artillery positions have appeared.\nAt this point in the war, it is clear that long-range weapons that can fire beyond sight of their targets, such as howitzers and multiple launch rocket systems, have proven important when holding and taking territory.\nSo far, Russia’s new campaign in the Donbas appears to rely heavily on those weapons, as does Ukraine’s defense.\nStrikes across Ukraine over the last several days had signaled a new escalation: In Kharkiv, for instance, Russian artillery slammed into a frequently shelled residential area on Tuesday, killing at least three people. That strike followed days of blistering rocket and artillery attacks into what had been relatively unscathed parts of the city, Ukraine’s second largest.\nOther urban centers like Zaporizhzhia in southern-central Ukraine, Lviv in the far west and Kyiv, the capital in the north, were hit with cruise missiles and artillery fire as Russian forces prepared ground troops for their thrust in the Donbas.\nThe Donbas battle, on wide-open terrain, will look significantly different from the urban warfare around Kyiv, where the Russian military tried and failed to advance.\nThis does not mean that Ukraine no longer needs the anti-tank and air-defense systems that have been so effective so far, military analysts said. In addition, the Ukrainians will need powerful arms to enable a counteroffensive of their own.\nThe $800 million military aid package to Ukraine that President Biden announced last week for the first time included more sophisticated artillery weaponry as well as 200 armored personnel carriers. In a conference call with allies on Tuesday, Mr. Biden promised more artillery for Ukraine’s forces.\n“If deployed in significant numbers, these types of weapons can keep the Russian forces under withering attack, stalling their offensive momentum and potentially dislodging them from dug-in positions,” Lt. Col. Tyson Wetzel of the Air Force and Col. J.B. Barranco of the Marine Corps, wrote in an Atlantic Council analysis last week.\n“This phase of the conflict will be distinct from phase one, with a greater focus on offensives against dug-in combatants as opposed to Ukrainian defense against a large attacking force,” Colonels Wetzel and Barranco wrote. “The campaign is likely to become a bloody war of attrition with limited territorial gains on either side.”\nCapturing the besieged city of Mariupol is a key part of the Russian campaign. The fall of the city, which has come to symbolize the death and devastation wrought by the invasion, would allow Russia to complete a land bridge between Russian-held territory and the Crimean peninsula.\nA sprawling Soviet-era steel factory in Mariupol, which its designers have said was built to withstand a nuclear attack, has been sheltering thousands of soldiers and civilians and is the last Ukrainian redoubt there.\nRussian commanders said Tuesday they were beginning their final assault on the factory, the Azovstal steel plant, after the defenders had rejected ultimatums to surrender. A Ukrainian officer in Mariupol, Maj. Sergiy Volyna, wrote on a Telegram channel that “we are ready to fight to the last drop of blood.”",

      "headline": "The U.S. Races to Arm Ukraine With Heavier, More Advanced Weaponry",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/europe/us-ukraine-weaponry.html",
      "text": "BRUSSELS — The race is on.\nAs columns of Russian troops began pouring into Ukraine nearly two months ago, the United States and its allies started supplying Kyiv with weapons and equipment for what many expected to be a short war: sniper rifles, helmets, medical kits, encrypted communications, lots of bullets and the portable, shoulder-held Stinger and Javelin missiles that quickly became icons of the conflict.\nDefying the odds, Ukraine held on to its capital and pushed Russia from the north. Now, as the Kremlin switches gears and begins a concerted effort to capture eastern Ukraine, Washington and its allies are pivoting as well, scrambling to supply Ukraine with bigger and more advanced weapons to defend itself in a grinding war.\nThe West is focused on sending longer-range weapons like howitzers, antiaircraft systems, anti-ship missiles, armed drones, armored trucks, personnel carriers and even tanks — the type of arms that President Biden said were tailored to stop “the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine.”\n“The steady supply of weapons” has helped “ensure that Putin failed in his initial war aims to conquer and control Ukraine,” Mr. Biden said last week. “We cannot rest now.”\nThen, after a video call with allies on Tuesday, Mr. Biden told reporters that the United States would send more artillery to Ukraine. He is expected to announce a new military aid package for Ukraine in the coming days, according to a person briefed on his plans. The aid amount will be on par with the $800 million package of weapons and artillery that was announced last week, the person said.\nBut the strategy comes with a notable risk: antagonizing Russia so much that it ignites a wider, international conflict.\nRussia recently sent a formal warning to the United States, saying that Western deliveries of the “most sensitive” weapons systems to Ukraine could bring “unpredictable consequences.”\nAmerican officials say the warning shows that the weapons being sent are making a big difference on the battlefield. So, for Washington at least, concerns about supplying arms that Russia might consider “escalatory” have ebbed — as has the initial worry that Ukraine will use longer-range weapons, like jet fighters, to attack Moscow itself and set off a bigger war.\nOfficials in Washington are now grappling with how much intelligence to give the Ukrainians about bases inside Russia, given that the Ukrainians have already made small helicopter raids on Russian fuel depots. The White House has also held back on supplying some weapons that could strike Russian forces across the border, like rocket artillery, ground attack planes and medium range drones.\nSome argue the Americans are being too cautious.\n“Seven weeks ago, they were arguing over whether to give Stinger missiles — how silly does that seem now?” said retired Lt. Gen. Frederick B. Hodges, the former top U.S. Army commander in Europe. “We have been deterred out of an exaggerated fear of what possibly could happen.”\nAnxiety about provoking a wider war persists among some NATO allies, most visibly in Germany, which worries that supplying Marder infantry-fighting vehicles, considered one of the world’s best armored vehicles, could be perceived by Russia as making Berlin and NATO parties to the war.\nRobert Habeck, an influential minister in Germany’s new government, has said that supplying tanks would be an escalation and should be a matter of consensus within NATO and the European Union. “Heavy weapons are synonymous with tanks, and all NATO countries have so far ruled this out to not become targets themselves,” he said.\nBut these are sovereign — not alliance — decisions, and Washington and numerous allies are shipping such weapons anyway, concentrating on supplying Soviet-era weapons that the Ukrainians know how to use, along with Western arms the Ukrainians can absorb fairly easily.\nRussia is striking Ukraine with abandon, complicating the flow of these newer weapons from Ukraine’s western borders with Poland, Romania and Slovakia to the battle in the east. That presents another risk: that Russian attacks could also stray across the Ukrainian border and hit NATO countries, “every inch” of which Mr. Biden has vowed to defend militarily.\nHow this logistical race goes could well shape the outcome of the war.\nRussian forces, having suffered an embarrassing retreat from northern Ukraine and the suburbs of the capital, Kyiv, are repositioning for what the Kremlin and Ukrainian officials call a pivotal offensive to take eastern Ukraine.\nUnlike many of the earlier battles, this one is expected to feature more tank battles on open ground, more long-range artillery and more weaponized drones.\nThe Western effort is both sprawling and expensive, with as many as 30 countries, not all of them members of NATO. The push now is to get countries with Soviet-era tanks, artillery and perhaps even fighter planes to provide them to Ukraine, with the promise that the United States will replenish them with more modern, Western-made arms in return. There is an especially acute need for Soviet-bloc standard 152-millimeter howitzer shells, since NATO uses a different, 155-millimeter shell.\nThe United States has also agreed to provide some 155-millimeter howitzers, along with 40,000 matching rounds, while trying to buy Soviet-standard ammunition from countries that use it, including nations outside of Europe, like Afghanistan and even India, a longstanding buyer of Russian arms.\nBut that is not enough, General Hodges argued. “We are still not thinking big,” he said. “We are still not thinking in terms of Ukraine winning.”\nUnlike the early part of the war, when many countries seemed to compete to announce what they were providing Ukraine, the current race is being run largely in secret.\nMuch of the coordination, including how to get matériel into Ukraine, is being handled through the United States European Command, or Eucom, based in Stuttgart, Germany, and through a blandly named International Donors Coordination Center set up with the British.\nThe command said that it established a “control center” to coordinate weapons and humanitarian assistance “from around the world” for Ukraine in early March. But it declined to discuss the details.\nThe Pentagon gave a hint, saying that the State Department had authorized transfers to Ukraine of American-provided defensive equipment from more than 14 countries this year.\nBut nations are trying not to advertise to Moscow exactly what is being provided. France says it has supplied 100 million euros of military equipment to Ukraine, without specifying what it has sent. Some countries have no desire to goad the Russian bear.\nA clear example was the confusion over reports that Poland had supplied more than 100 Soviet-era T-72 and T-55 tanks to Ukraine. Poland refuses to confirm any such shipment.\nNot all nations are being coy. The Czech government says it has supplied Ukraine with T-72 tanks and BMP-1 armored vehicles, while the Slovak government has made a big show of supplying a Soviet-era S-300 antiaircraft missile system.\nAs for Germany, part of the problem is that its own supply of working armor is so low that it has little to spare. Beyond that, learning to operate a modern British, American or German tank can take up to six months, while Ukrainian fighters would have little difficulty operating familiar Soviet-era armor.\n“We don’t really have time to get a lot of heavy American armor into Ukraine, and there isn’t time to train the Ukrainian military,” said Robert M. Gates, former U.S. defense secretary. “But there is a lot of former Soviet military equipment still in the arsenals of the East European states.”\nThe United States, he said, “ought to be ransacking the arsenals” of former Warsaw Pact countries for armor and antiaircraft systems, “with a promise from the U.S. to backfill over time with our equipment to our NATO allies.”\nThat is exactly what the United States is racing to do, Pentagon officials said, describing their own efforts to persuade the Slovaks to provide the S-300 missile system to Ukraine. On March 9, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III began speaking with their defense minister, Jaroslav Nad, and has agreed to send in Patriot batteries to replace it.\nSimilar conversations are taking place with other allies that have Soviet-era weapons and ammunition, the officials said. The Americans say they are also speaking several times a day with their Ukrainian counterparts about what Ukraine wants and needs, and what Western countries think they can best provide.\nUkraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, repeatedly expresses gratitude for the aid but wants more, sooner. He admitted to being fed up with listing the same set of requirements over and over again to different national interlocutors, telling The Atlantic in Kyiv: “When some leaders ask me what weapons I need, I need a moment to calm myself, because I already told them the week before. It’s Groundhog Day. I feel like Bill Murray.”\nThere are also supply issues with Western weapons, like the older Stinger antiaircraft missile or the Javelin anti-tank missile.\nThe Pentagon has urged manufacturers to ramp up production. So far, some 7,000 Javelins have been given to Ukraine, about a third of the total American inventory, which will probably take three or four years to replace, wrote Mark F. Cancian of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\nLast week, the Pentagon met with leaders of eight large military contractors, like Raytheon Company and Lockheed Martin Corporation, to discuss how to overcome any supply problems — both to replenish American weapons stocks that have been drawn down to help Ukraine and to keep Kyiv in the fight. The two companies together make the Javelin, and Raytheon makes the Stinger.\nThe United States alone has spent or allocated some $2.6 billion worth of such matériel since the war began on Feb. 24, and the European Union has provided 1.5 billion euros, or $1.6 billion. But there is no prospect of American or NATO troops going to the aid of Ukraine, officials say. The West is providing the weapons and intelligence — and cheerleading from behind.\nThe known list of what has been provided already is long, and there is little doubt that supplies from NATO countries — and the training of Ukrainian forces after Russia seized Crimea in 2014, not to mention Ukraine’s tenacity and adaptability — have surprised the Russians, badly damaged their morale and extended the war.\nIn the months leading up to the war and afterward, the United States and its allies have sent Ukraine 25,000 antiaircraft weapons and 60,000 anti-tank weapons, including 10,000 provided by Washington, Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress last week.\nThe United States has also provided more than 50 million rounds of ammunition, 7,000 small arms, 75,000 sets of body armor and helmets, and night-vision goggles, encrypted radios, armored trucks and personnel carriers, largely drawn from pre-positioned U.S. military stockpiles, much of it in Europe, according to the latest public list from the Pentagon.\nSince the invasion, the Pentagon has cranked up its vast logistical and transportation network. Within four to six days after the White House approves a transfer of weapons from American military stockpiles, the Pentagon has been able to load the matériel onto cargo planes and fly it to about half a dozen staging bases in countries near Ukraine, chiefly Poland and Romania.\nFrom there, American officials say, the weapons and equipment are loaded onto hundreds of trucks and shipped into western Ukraine using a variety of overland routes. John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said it takes about 24 to 48 hours for the weapons to make their way from the staging areas into the hands of Ukrainian troops.\n“Eight to 10 flights a day are coming into the region, not just from the United States, but from other nations as well,” Mr. Kirby said. “That stuff isn’t sitting around.”\nDespite repeated threats to do so, the Russians have rarely tried to stop this flow of Western matériel into Ukraine. Pentagon officials say the Russians have been busy fighting in other parts of the country and fear Ukraine’s air defenses. “That flow still continues,” Mr. Kirby said.\nBritain, which has been more public about its contributions in the post-Brexit period, has supplied about $588 million of matériel, including anti-tank and anti-ship missiles and long-range artillery.\nTraining the Ukrainians on new equipment in the middle of a war is a challenge, though. About a dozen Ukrainian soldiers were already training in the United States, and the Pentagon has taught them to use modern armed drones, like the 700 or so Switchblade drones that Washington is now providing.\nMilitary officials call the weapon, which is carried in a backpack, the “kamikaze drone,” because it can be flown directly at a tank or a group of troops and is destroyed when it hits the target and explodes.\nBigger armed drones, like American-made Predators or Reapers, would be difficult for Ukrainians to fly and would be easily destroyed by Russian fighter planes. But Pentagon officials said the small, portable kamikaze drones could prove more cost-effective and elusive against Russian armored convoys.\nAfter the White House announced the latest $800 million tranche of weapons for Ukraine last week, Mr. Kirby said that American soldiers would train Ukrainian forces in neighboring countries to use some of the newer, more sophisticated equipment Washington is providing, like radar systems, as well as the 155-millimeter howitzers and 11 Mi-17 helicopters.\n“We’re aware of the clock, and we know time is not our friend,” he said.",

      "headline": "Myanmar’s Health System Is in Collapse, ‘Obliterated’ by the Regime",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/19/world/asia/myanmars-coup-doctors.html",
      "text": "The surgeon was in the middle of operating on a patient when the squad of soldiers entered the hospital looking for doctors to arrest. A receptionist alerted the surgeon, Dr. Kyaw Swar, but it was too late for him to stop the procedure.\nHoping to avoid attention, he ran out into the hallway and collected the shoes that he and his colleagues had left outside the operating room door — a telltale sign that surgery was underway. Moments later, the soldiers walked noisily past the operating theater.\n“If they had found us, they would have arrested us,” Dr. Kyaw Swar said. “But I will not run away while I am operating on a patient. It is not a crime for a doctor to treat patients.”\nDr. Kyaw Swar’s close call last month came as Myanmar’s security forces intensify their crackdown on doctors who oppose the military junta that seized power 14 months ago. Doctors have been at the forefront of a nationwide civil disobedience movement that has crippled the economy, and the regime has targeted health care workers from the start.\nIn recent weeks, the security forces have arrested doctors at their homes and hospitals, revoked the licenses of prominent physicians, searched hospitals for wounded resistance fighters and threatened to close health care facilities that employ doctors opposing the regime.\nFor Myanmar soldiers, who are notorious for stealing from citizens, going after doctors is also a convenient way to make money, since doctors are among the country’s wealthier people. During arrests, soldiers have seized cash, gold, jewelry and vehicles worth tens of thousands of dollars. In some cases, army officers have demanded as much as $5,000 not to shut down a private hospital, hospital officials said.\nSince the coup on Feb. 1, 2021, soldiers and the police have arrested 140 doctors for participating in the nationwide protest movement, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which is monitoring arrests. Of these, 89 remain behind bars.\nAt least 30 doctors have been killed, according to the New York-based Physicians for Human Rights, which called Myanmar one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a health worker.\nThe harassment and arrest of doctors who oppose the regime comes as the country faces a continuing health emergency because of a severe shortage of doctors, a chronic lack of resources and the closing of many hospitals and clinics.\nIn a statement earlier this month marking World Health Day, a rights group, Network for Human Rights Documentation Burma, said the Myanmar military has “destabilized the country beyond repair.”\n“The health care sector is one of many which has been obliterated,” the group said.\nNearly one million children are not receiving routine immunizations, leaving them vulnerable to measles and other diseases, and nearly 5 million children are missing out on vitamin A supplements, putting them at risk of infections and blindness, according to UNICEF.\nThroughout the country, barely 40 percent of the population is fully vaccinated for Covid-19, and many patients are left without routine care. Needed operations are difficult to schedule.\nDoctors say that health care has improved somewhat in recent months in Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, with many physicians returning to work. But anti-regime doctors estimate that hundreds of people are still dying each week because of the collapse of the health care system.\nOne regime tactic has been to release doctors from prison on the condition that they disavow the civil disobedience movement and agree to work at a military-controlled, government hospital, doctors said.\n“In conflict-torn areas, it’s worse than in cities because the government hospitals are not running at all and people are mostly in refugee camps in the jungle,” said Dr. Wai Myo, who was fired from Mandalay General Hospital last year for joining the protest movement. “So, if something happens to them, the chance of death is very high.”\nA spokeswoman for the junta’s health ministry declined to comment.\nAfter the coup, thousands of doctors refused to work for the regime and left jobs in government facilities. Many began offering their services free at private hospitals and underground clinics.\nIn its attempt to force doctors to work in facilities it controls, the military has shut down at least a dozen clinics offering free medical treatment and demanded that private hospitals and clinics hand over the names of patients and their medical history.\nAs it hunts down anti-regime doctors and wounded combatants, the regime has branded people seeking care from underground clinics as “illegal patients.”\n“What is the reason to arrest us?” asked Dr. Wai Myo. “Just for giving treatment? It’s total nonsense. I want to be a good citizen, so I joined the civil disobedience movement. I want to be a good doctor, so I’m giving free medical treatment to patients.”\nMandalay General Hospital, a major teaching hospital in Myanmar’s second-largest city, has been at the center of the protest movement since the start. Doctors in Mandalay have been much slower than those in other regions to return to work at government-controlled centers.\nLast month, the city’s health director and the army general who is Mandalay’s chief commander summoned private hospital owners to a meeting and informed them that the licenses of 14 medical professors and leading specialists at Mandalay General Hospital would be revoked, according to hospital owners who attended the meeting.\nThey warned that any private hospital that hired them — or other doctors known to support the civil disobedience movement — would be shut down.\nThe loss of highly trained doctors can have life-or-death consequences for some patients.\nLieu Shin, a rice farmer from Kalay, 160 miles northwest of Mandalay, is in desperate need of a kidney transplant, and his brother has agreed to donate one. But Mandalay General Hospital, the only place in the region where such surgery could be done, no longer has a team of doctors capable of performing the operation.\nMr. Lieu Shin, 64, was given only days to live, but continues to hang on with dialysis, which is exhausting his family’s savings. He blames the regime for his inability to get treatment, not the doctors.\n“The doctors said I need an emergency operation,” he said. “But there are not enough doctors at the hospital. All I can do now is wait for my turn to die.”",

      "text": "Martin Griffiths, the top humanitarian chief at the United Nations, said he tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday as he was visiting the U.N. headquarters in New York from a recent trip to Afghanistan, Russia and Ukraine.\nMr. Griffiths met on Monday with the U.N.’s secretary general, António Guterres, but everyone in the room was wearing masks and social distancing was observed, according to Stéphane Dujarric, the secretary general’s spokesman.\nMr. Dujarric said all meetings with Mr. Guterres, who is 72, follow strict masking and distancing protocols, and members of his staff are routinely tested. However, the U.N. headquarters no longer enforces masking and testing to enter the building, Mr. Dujarric said.\nMr. Griffiths appeared unmasked at a briefing with reporters on Monday and several reporters in attendance were also not masked. Journalists at the U.N.’s daily briefings are often asked to take off their masks when asking questions, a request that can potentially expose them to the virus if anyone in the room happens to have the virus but is asymptomatic.\n“I am following health guidance, cancelled travel, and isolating at home,” tweeted Mr. Griffiths. “I’m grateful to have had my vaccines already, an opportunity too many around the world have not had.”\nMr. Griffiths was planning to travel to Turkey and to meet with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss how the U.N. can support Turkey’s mediation efforts between Russia and Ukraine for a peace deal.\nThe U.N. tried and failed to negotiate a humanitarian cease-fire in Ukraine, a temporary halt in fighting that would have allowed the evacuation of civilians from conflict areas and secure safe passage for aid convoys, Mr. Griffiths said. He said Russia had not responded to his proposals for either a humanitarian cease-fire or improvement on access for aid workers.\nThe World Health Organization warned in early March that the war in Ukraine would increase the transmission of the coronavirus and the number of people at risk of severe disease because of mass displacement and strain on health care facilities.",

      "text": "ZIPOLITE, Mexico — When the sun starts to slip toward the ocean in this idyllic beach town on Mexico’s Pacific Coast, a quiet migration begins. Groups of people, most of them gay men, many of them naked, amble down the beach toward a soaring rocky outcrop.\nThey climb a winding staircase, over the ragged cliff and down to a hidden cove known as Playa del Amor, or beach of love. As the sun becomes an orange orb, the sky turns to lilac, and the many naked bodies, Black and bronze, curvy and chiseled, are brushed in gold. When it finally dips into the water, the crowd erupts in applause.\n“Playa del Amor at sunset, the first time I saw it I truly felt like crying,” said Roberto Jerr, 32, who has been visiting Zipolite for five years. “It’s a space where you can be very free.”\nFor decades, this former fishing village turned hippie hangout has been an oasis for the queer community, which is drawn to its golden beaches, countercultural vibe and a practice of nudism that embraces bodies of all different shapes.\nBut as its popularity has grown, attracting increasing numbers of gay and straight visitors, the town is starting to transform: Foreigners are snatching up land, hotels are multiplying, influencers are flocking to the beach and many residents and visitors now fear that what once made Zipolite magical could be lost for good.\n“Everyone in the community should visit a place where they can feel comfortable, where they can feel free, like Zipolite,” said Mr. Jerr, who is gay. “But on the other hand, there’s also this other part, this ultramass tourism that starts to leave places without resources.”\nOnce a community of farmers and fishermen, Zipolite became a popular destination for European hippies and backpackers starting in 1970, when many came to the beaches of Oaxaca state for an exceptionally clear view of a solar eclipse. Hippie tourism gave the town a bohemian spirit — it’s one of Mexico’s few nude beaches — that also began attracting queer people, who were welcomed by most residents. In February, Zipolite elected the first openly gay person to head the town council.\nSuch tolerant attitudes are rare outside of big cities in Mexico, where conservative Catholic values persist. Despite gay marriage being legalized in more than half the country, homophobic and transphobic violence is common. Between 2016 and 2020, some 440 lesbian, gay and transgender people were killed across the country, according to Letra Ese, an advocacy group in Mexico City.\nDavid Montes Bernal, 33, grew up a few hours from Zipolite in a conservative community where machismo and homophobia were entrenched. When he was about 9, the town priest performed what he called “practically an exorcism” to force the homosexuality out of him.\n“That’s when I realized that it was a hostile place,” Mr. Bernal said.\nIn Zipolite, he has found a place where he can be comfortable in his sexuality and secure in his body.\n“I felt a kind of hope,” Mr. Bernal said of his first visit in 2014. “Finally it seems like now there’s a place where we can be whoever we want.”\nAs word of this openness has spread, the town’s L.G.B.T.Q. population has surged: gay bars and hotels have multiplied, rainbow flags are commonplace.\nBut, as accepting as many locals are, some feel that Zipolite’s identity as a laid-back town that welcomes anyone from Mexican families to Canadian retirees is being eroded, that it is transforming into a gay party town.\nMiguel Ángel Ziga Aragón, a local resident who is gay himself and goes by “La Chavelona,” has watched the local economy boom, not just because of gay tourism but from a surge in tourism generally. While once hosting mostly rustic cabins and hammocks along the beach, Zipolite’s tourism scene has become what he calls “more V.I.P.”: Beachfront suites now go for as much as $500 a night.\nThe growth in tourism in Zipolite reflects a statewide trend in Oaxaca: From 2017 to 2019, income from the hotel industry rose by more than a third to nearly $240 million. In the same period, the number of tourists visiting hotels in the coastal region that includes Zipolite grew by almost 40 percent to about 330,000 people, according to government figures.\n“It’s a change that’s good for the economy, but not so good for the community,” Mr. Ziga Aragón said. \nAlong with an identity crisis, many fear an environmental one. Mangroves have been built over; the wildlife is disappearing. Residents complain of a lack of running water, which could be worsened by greater development.\nWhile most residents agree that more planning is needed, some say the transformation is inevitable.\n“It’s the life cycle of every tourist destination,” said Elyel Aquino Méndez, who runs a gay travel agency. “You have to take advantage of the opportunity.”\nBut others fear that Zipolite could go the way of many Mexican beach towns that have become thriving resorts, like the popular gay destination of Puerto Vallarta or, more recently, Tulum. Once a bohemian paradise, the Caribbean beach of Tulum has become a lucrative real estate market filled with luxury hotels, celebrity influencers and, increasingly, violence.\nPouria Farsani, 33, who lives in Stockholm, enjoyed the combination of beautiful nature and fun partying when he first visited Tulum in 2018, but by the time he went back last September found that it felt “like a party-colonized part of Mexico.”\nMr. Farsani heard about Zipolite from some Mexican friends and visited for the first time in January 2021 — he was enchanted.\n“When I’ve seen other gay scenes, it’s been very stereotypical,” he said. “What was going on here was people of all body shapes, ages, socioeconomic status, all of us could gather here.”\nThe body positivity in Zipolite is partly what makes the nudist beach special to many, gay or straight: For Mr. Farsani, who has alopecia, a hair-loss condition, it was particularly profound.\n“I’m very happy with my body, but I’m not the Ken-doll type,” he said. “It scares people in Europe, while here my alopecia is nothing more than it makes me stand out a little more.”\nStill, as Zipolite’s popularity has grown, its hippie vibe is shifting. Bars are louder, restaurants are becoming swankier. The L.G.B.T.Q. tourism is changing too, becoming increasingly Americanized, less diverse.\nIvanna Camarena, a transgender woman, spent six months in Zipolite last year and met only a handful of other transgender people. “The bodies were very athletic and very masculine,” she said of the people she saw on the beach in her first few months there.\nShe recalled going to a nudist party that was almost exclusively gay men. “When I got there it was like ‘Wow what is a trans woman doing here?’ Like, they were weirded out.”\nAmong the noticeable shifts is what has happened at Playa del Amor, which once hosted bonfires and guitar playing and now often has laser lights and D.J.s playing house music. People used to chat across different social groups; now, the beach has become more segregated into cliques.\nThe sex scene has evolved too. While visitors, including straight couples, have engaged in sex on the beach after dark for decades, in recent years it has become more brazen, with dance parties sometimes morphing into group sex in the shadows.\n“Every time it’s more hedonistic, more hedonistic, more hedonistic,” said Ignacio Rubio Carriquiriborde, a sociology professor at Mexico’s National Autonomous University who has studied Zipolite for years. “Now there’s more a dynamic of constant partying.”\nMany residents have grown uncomfortable, and the town council recently voted to enforce a 9 p.m. beach curfew to curb such activities.\n“One thing is freedom and another thing is debauchery,” Mr. Ziga Aragón said. “You can have sex with whoever you want, but in private.”\nFor others, the concern is more environmental. Miguel Ángel López Méndez runs a small hotel near Playa del Amor, and says that revelers often leave the beach a mess. Once, while diving off the cove, he recalled seeing condoms floating “like jellyfish.”\n“Everyone is free to do whatever they want with their body,” he said. “The problem is that there’s no awareness.”\nFor some gay men, the open sexuality of Playa del Amor is part of its power.\n“From when you’re a kid, you’re forbidden from so many things: ‘Don’t be like that,’ ‘Don’t say this,’ ‘Don’t do that,’” said Mr. Bernal, who lives in the nearby town of Puerto Ángel. “Suddenly, with sex being an act of catharsis, so many things are liberated.”\nStill, Mr. Bernal also worries for the future of the town, where tourism is booming, natural resources are scarce, and so many foreigners are buying up properties that the price of land has become largely unaffordable for locals.\n“Everyone comes here on vacation to consume something,” he said. “A piece of the beach, a piece of your body, a piece of the party, a piece of nature.”",

      "text": "PARIS — France’s presidential election entered a new, intense phase on Tuesday as President Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate trying to unseat him, traded barbs from afar and rubbed shoulders with voters in hopes of widening their appeal, especially on the left.\nMr. Macron, who spent the day in eastern France, and Ms. Le Pen, who was campaigning in Normandy, are competing in the second round of voting in the elections, a rematch of their 2017 face-off that will be held on April 24.\nIn the first round of voting on Sunday, both attracted a bigger share of voters than they did five years ago — Mr. Macron with 27.85 percent of the vote, up from 24.01 in 2017, and Ms. Le Pen, of the National Rally party, with 23.15 percent. It was the largest proportion ever gained by a far-right candidate in the first round of voting, and almost 2 percentage points more than in 2017.\nThe latest polls predict a very close runoff, and put Mr. Macron only slightly ahead.\nWith less than two weeks to go before the vote, Mr. Macron has picked up the pace, seeking to dispel criticism that his campaign ahead of the first round was unfocused and that he appeared distracted by his diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine.\nIn Mulhouse, a city in the Alsace region, Mr. Macron navigated crowds to shake the hands of those who supported him and debate those who did not, many of whom sharply questioned him on issues like purchasing power, welfare benefits and hospital funding.\n“I’m on the field,” Mr. Macron pointedly told a scrum of television reporters, emphasizing that for the past two days he had chosen to meet voters in towns that had not voted for him.\nHe sought to portray Ms. Le Pen as unfit to govern.\nMs. Le Pen, for example, says she has no intention of leaving the European Union — but many of her promised policies would flout its rules. Mr. Macron dismissed her assurances as “carabistouilles,” an old-fashioned term that roughly translates to “claptrap” or “nonsense.”\n“The election is also a referendum on Europe,” Mr. Macron said later at a public meeting in Strasbourg, where supporters waved French and European Union flags in the shadow of the city’s imposing cathedral.\nRoland Lescure, a lawmaker in France’s lower house of Parliament for Mr. Macron’s party, La République en Marche, said that the campaign was now focused on getting Mr. Macron as much direct face time with voters as possible.\n“The method is contact,” Mr. Lescure said, warning that there is a real risk of Ms. Le Pen being elected. “We have to campaign at full speed and until the end.”\nMr. Macron’s stature as a leader who was at the helm throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine is not enough to secure him a new term, and neither is admonishing voters about the threat of the far right, Mr. Lescure said.\n“It’s not the devil against the angel,” he said. “It’s social models that are fundamentally opposed. We need to show what Marine Le Pen’s platform would do to France.”\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Macron was endorsed by Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s right-wing president from 2007 to 2012. Ms. Le Pen’s campaign unveiled an official poster reminiscent of Mr. Macron’s official presidential portrait. Ms. Le Pen’s has a tagline: “For all the French.”\nAfter the collapse of France’s traditional left-wing and right-wing parties on Sunday, much of the candidates’ energy is now devoted to wooing voters who either abstained in the first round or picked Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the radical leftist and veteran politician who came in a strong third place, with 21.95 percent of the vote.\nFor Ms. Le Pen, that means highlighting economic proposals like a lower sales tax on essential goods, but also keeping Éric Zemmour, another far-right politician, at arm’s length.\nMr. Zemmour, a pundit who shook up French politics with his presidential bid, came in fourth on Sunday, and polls suggest that over 80 percent of those who picked him in the first round intend to vote for Ms. Le Pen in the second. That gives her little incentive to court them openly as she tries to reinvent herself in the eyes of mainstream voters.\nOn Tuesday, Ms. Le Pen flatly rejected the possibility of making Mr. Zemmour one of her ministers should she win, telling France Inter radio that “he doesn’t wish to and neither do I.”\nFor Mr. Macron, attracting Mr. Mélenchon’s voters means toning down proposals that are particularly taboo on the left, especially his plans to raise the legal age of retirement from 62 to 65, which he says is necessary to keep funding France’s state pension system.\nOn Monday, he insisted that he would gradually push back the retirement age by four months per year starting in 2023, but he said he was open to discussing a softening of the plan in its later stages, although how and to what degree is still unclear. During his first term, Mr. Macron’s pension proposals were derailed by massive strikes and protests.\nMs. Le Pen, speaking Tuesday at a news conference in Vernon, a town in Normandy where she also mingled with crowds, dismissed Mr. Macron’s concession as a feeble attempt to attract left-wing voters, and called his platform “social carnage.”\nShe detailed several proposals that she hoped would attract voters who supported Mr. Mélenchon, like creating a mechanism for referendums proposed by popular initiative, or introducing proportional representation in Parliament.\n“I intend to be a president who gives the people their voice back,” she said.\nMr. Mélenchon was particularly popular with urban voters, coming ahead in cities like Lille, Marseille, Montpellier and Nantes, and he scored high with France’s youth. One study by the Ipsos and Sopra Steria polling institutes found that over 30 percent of those 35 and younger had voted for him, more than for any other candidate.\nMarie Montagne, 21, and Ellina Abdellaoui, 22, both English literature students standing in front of the Sorbonne University in Paris, said that Mr. Mélenchon had not necessarily been their first choice — online quizzes suggested to Ms. Abdellaoui that she was most compatible with Philippe Poutou, a fringe anticapitalist candidate.\nBut Mr. Mélenchon’s leftist, ecological platform was still appealing, they said, and he seemed like the left-wing candidate best positioned to reach the runoff. Now, though, the two students said they faced a difficult choice.\n“I am hesitating between abstaining and Macron,” Ms. Abdellaoui said. “I can’t vote for Le Pen.”\nMs. Montagne said she would vote for the incumbent “because I don’t want the smallest chance of the far-right passing.”\n“But I won’t vote for him because I enjoy it,” she added.",

      "text": "Ukraine’s security service said on Tuesday that officers had detained Viktor Medvedchuk, a politician and oligarch seen as the Kremlin’s main agent of influence in Ukraine in recent years.\nMr. Medvedchuk disappeared shortly after the start of the war and the Ukrainian authorities were searching for him. \nIvan Bakanov, the head of the Security Service of Ukraine, said on Facebook that officers had conducted a “lightning-fast and dangerous multilevel special operation” to detain Mr. Medvedchuk. \nDmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said he could not confirm that Mr. Medvedchuk had been arrested, according to Russian state media. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine posted a photo on Telegram that appeared to show Mr. Medvedchuk in handcuffs.\nMr. Medvedchuk’s arrest would be a significant blow to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who is reported to be the godfather to Mr. Medvedchuk’s daughter and counts him as one of his closest allies in Ukraine. \nA longtime influential player in politics and business between Ukraine and Russia, he was an adviser in the office of President Leonid Kuchma after Ukraine’s independence and took part in negotiations with separatists in eastern Ukraine after Russia’s annexation of Crimea.\nBefore the war, Mr. Medvedchuk had been under house arrest on suspicion of treason, attempted looting of national resources and aiding and abetting a terrorist organization, according to local media. \nA Ukrainian official, Mykhailo Podolyak, a member of Ukraine’s delegation for peace talks in Istanbul, said on Twitter that Mr. Medvedchuk had “regularly lied about the situation” in Ukraine, and “stole money and eventually became one of the initiators of the war.”",

      "headline": "Boris Johnson Fined for Breaking U.K. Lockdown Rules",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/12/world/europe/boris-johnson-partygate-fines-rishi-sunak.html",
      "text": "LONDON — In recent weeks Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain has revived his fortunes at home by becoming Europe’s most aggressive supporter of Ukraine’s fierce fight against Russian invasion.\nBut on Tuesday Mr. Johnson was battling for his own survival again, after police fined him for attending a lockdown party in Downing Street that broke coronavirus laws made in the very same building.\nMr. Johnson said on Tuesday night that he had paid the fine, though he did not say how much it was, insisting that he would continue in his job despite calls for his resignation, including from the opposition Labour leader. He added: “I once again offer a full apology.”\nThe announcement earlier Tuesday by London’s Metropolitan Police made Mr. Johnson the first holder of his office in living memory to be found in breach of the law, and provoked anger from Britons who obeyed strict coronavirus rules that sometimes even forbade contact with dying relatives.\nIt also prompted opposition politicians to accuse Mr. Johnson of lying to Parliament by denying that breaches of coronavirus rules occurred in Downing Street or other government buildings. That is dangerous territory for Mr. Johnson because, in Britain, ministers are normally expected to resign if they mislead their fellow lawmakers.\nBut the announcement came after several weeks in which Mr. Johnson has stabilized his leadership through robust support for Ukraine’s resistance against Russian military aggression, culminating in his surprise weekend visit to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.\nThe media’s focus on the war has defused the air of crisis around Downing Street and prompted several internal critics who had made formal demands for a vote of no-confidence in Mr. Johnson, to retract them.\nOne of those, Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said on Tuesday that, with conflict raging in Ukraine, “it wouldn’t be right to remove the prime minister at this time.”\nNonetheless the latest twist in the “partygate” saga is an extraordinary development even for Mr. Johnson who has a reputation for extracting himself from crises of his own making.\nIn a statement, London’s Metropolitan Police said it would issue fines for at least 50 breaches of the law as part of its inquiry into the “partygate” scandal that, earlier this year, threatened to sweep Mr. Johnson from power after reports emerged of politicians and officials gathering and drinking in Downing Street and other government buildings despite coronavirus rules.\nThe police did not name any of those to be fined, but the prime minister’s office later said that Mr. Johnson and the chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, had both been notified that they had broken the law.\nMr. Sunak said Tuesday night that he had also paid his fine and apologized.\nMr. Johnson’s fine was for attending a party on his birthday on June 19, 2020, in the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street between 2 and 3 p.m., said a later statement from his office. His wife, Carrie Johnson, has also been told that she will be fined, her spokesperson said in a statement.\nOn Tuesday the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, was among those demanding Mr. Johnson’s resignation and critics have asked for Parliament, which is on Easter recess, to be recalled.\nMore important, however, was the muted reaction of lawmakers in the governing Conservative Party, the only group that could force a no-confidence motion for Mr. Johnson. Fifty-four of them would have to demand one.\nWhile that prospect seemed imminent earlier this year when the crisis erupted, the focus on the war in Ukraine has made that less likely.\nBecause lawmakers are on recess this week, it will be harder for Mr. Johnson’s internal critics to organize against him. Some of Mr. Johnson’s allies have argued in the past that receiving a fixed penalty notice is more akin to a speeding ticket than a successful prosecution and a group of loyal lawmakers have rallied around the prime minister in recent months.\nIn January, Conor Burns, a lawmaker and supporter of Mr. Johnson, dismissed reports of the birthday gathering for which Mr. Johnson was penalized on Tuesday as trivial. “He was, in a sense, ambushed with a cake,” Mr. Burns said, provoking much ridicule.\nThe prime minister’s position inside the Conservative Party has also been strengthened in recent days because of a crisis engulfing Mr. Sunak, the man many assumed to be in prime position to take over were Mr. Johnson to fall.\nThe situation remains precarious for Mr. Johnson. He is now in the uncomfortable position of being a prime minister known to have broken laws that he made himself and the scandal has been particularly damaging because, at the time of the Downing Street parties, Britons were facing extreme curbs on their liberties to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\n“Boris Johnson was partying and breaking his own lockdown rules, while we were unable to be at loved ones’ sides in their dying moments, or in miserable funerals with only a handful of people,” said a statement on Twitter from a group called Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice U.K.\n“There is simply no way either the prime minister or chancellor can continue. Their dishonesty has caused untold hurt to the bereaved,” it added.\nThe Metropolitan Police’s inquiry into the parties is still underway and its statement on Tuesday said that officers were “continuing to assess significant amounts of investigative material” — a hint, perhaps, that further fines are to come. Mr. Johnson is known to have attended at least one other event under investigation.\nEven after being judged to have broken the rules, Mr. Johnson faces further embarrassment because he has promised that, once the police investigation is complete, he will publish an internal government report into Downing Street parties. An interim version of that document, compiled by the senior civil servant Sue Gray, was damaging enough to precipitate the police investigation.\nAgainst this backdrop, Conservatives face a test of their popularity next month in local elections, and a poor result would further increase pressure on Mr. Johnson.\nBut before that Mr. Johnson is certain to face an angry reception from opposition politicians when Parliament returns next week, with some claiming that the code under which ministers serve requires his resignation for misleading them.\nThe prime minister had “knowingly lied” to Parliament and to the public when denying that lockdown-breaking parties had taken place, wrote Caroline Lucas, a lawmaker for the Greens, on Twitter. Under the ministerial code, ministers have a duty to uphold the law, she said, adding: “If he’s allowed to stay on, it would be a constitutional crisis.”\nAnd, though Mr. Johnson’s position has undoubtedly been strengthened by his handling of the crisis in Ukraine, as a biographer of Winston Churchill, he will know that Britain has replaced its prime ministers before in times of conflict, including during World War II.",

      "headline": "The world surpasses half a billion known coronavirus cases, amid concerns about testing.",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/12/world/world-covid-cases-testing.html",
      "text": "The coronavirus is continuing to stalk the world at an astonishing clip, racing past a grim succession of pandemic milestones in 2022: totals of 300 million known cases around the world by early January, 400 million by early February and, as of Tuesday, half a billion.\nThere have almost certainly been far more infections than that among the global population of 7.9 billion, with many going undetected or unreported, and the reporting gap may only grow wider as some countries, including the United States, scale back official testing.\n“That’s dangerous,” Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington, and formerly of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a recent interview. “If you don’t test, then you don’t know what variants you have.”\nRegional officials with the World Health Organization recently urged African countries to ramp up testing and contact tracing, and called for some countries in the Americas to double down on efforts to increase vaccination and testing as cases remained higher in Europe. (Britain, for instance, has ended free testing.) A W.H.O. analysis also recently estimated that 65 percent of Africans had been infected with the coronavirus as of September 2021, nearly 100 times the number of confirmed cases on the continent.\nThe number of new cases reported around the globe each day has been declining for some time now; the average over the past week has been about 1.1 million cases a day, according to the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. That’s about 32 percent fewer than two weeks ago.\nBut over the course of the pandemic, countries with limited public health resources may only have detected and confirmed a tiny fraction of the cases in their populations. And more recent figures may miss many at-home rapid test results that are never officially reported. Many people with infections are never tested at all, because they have no symptoms, or lack access to testing, or want to avoid the consequences of a positive test result, or choose not to for other reasons.\nCoronavirus deaths have also been declining. The world reported about 3,800 a day on average over the past week, 23 percent fewer than two weeks ago.\nStill, the director-general of the W.H.O., Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, recently said that the world remains in the acute phase of the pandemic, and many health experts agree.\nExperts’ warnings have not stopped many nations from dropping their pandemic precautions almost completely in the two months since the global case count surpassed 400 million. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidelines in late February suggesting that most Americans could stop wearing masks, and no longer needed to maintain social distance or avoid crowded indoor spaces.\n“What’s happening globally and in the U.S.,” Dr. Mokdad said, “is that people basically gave up. They just want to go back to normal life.”\nThat desire is threatened by the swift spread of the Omicron subvariant known as BA.2, the most transmissible version of the virus yet identified. BA.2 now accounts for the vast majority of new cases in the United States and around the world; it has spread even faster than BA.1, which helped fuel surges over the winter.\nThe peak of the most recent surge may have passed in some parts of Europe, but Hong Kong is still trying to escape an outbreak that began in January, and Shanghai residents are under lockdown and reporting food shortages.\n“The focus on new cases is warranted,” Crystal Watson, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said in a recent interview. “What we’re seeing in China is a very extreme surge in cases, because they have not had a lot of exposure there, and the vaccine is less effective there.”\nMore than 5.1 billion people — about 66.4 percent of the world population — have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford. More than 1.7 billion booster shots or additional doses have been administered globally. But coverage varies starkly among regions. Africa’s rates are the lowest of any continent, with about 20 percent of people having received at least one dose.",

      "headline": "An Angry Public Wants Sri Lanka’s President Gone",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/12/world/asia/sri-lanka-protests-gotabaya-rajapaksa.html",
      "text": "COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — As Sri Lankans waited hours in line for fuel, sweated through the springtime heat during daily power cuts, and watched the value of their incomes erode, the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, blamed forces beyond his control.\n“This crisis was not created by me,” he said in an address last month, urging the nation to “have faith” in his actions.\nTens of thousands of protesters are now swarming the streets of the capital, Colombo, and clashing with security forces outside the ruling family’s official residences. They are running low on essential goods and patience — and demanding that the president step down.\nSri Lanka was supposed to be a postwar success story, a fast-developing economy committed to healing after decades of conflict. Instead, it is the latest democratic nation backsliding into authoritarianism, under the misguided policies of a ruler who critics say is more focused on protecting his family’s political dynasty than the country’s fledgling institutions and economy.\nTo ensure his family’s political future, Mr. Rajapaksa, 72, has undermined the criminal justice system, jailed dissenters and quashed the opposition. He has drastically expanded his presidential powers, stocking the government with his relatives, fellow military men and right-wing monks aligned with his law-and-order mind-set.\nIt has left the country ill-equipped to deal with a growing economic and debt crisis. Its coffers are all but drained after the island nation was closed to tourists for much of the coronavirus pandemic and after a series of policy missteps. And on Tuesday, the government said it was suspending payments on its international debt, a signal that economic conditions could get worse.\nNow, Sri Lanka is trying to conserve cash for emergency supplies of fuel and other basic goods. The fertile country that produces some of the world’s most sought-after tea is facing widespread food insecurity. And protesters are filling the streets of Colombo, many of them young professionals who had taken for granted that they would have steady electricity and internet service, access to imported coffee and cars, as well as a promising future.\nShathurshan Jayantharaj’s fleet of delivery trucks came to a halt when diesel supplies dwindled. Mr. Jayantharaj, 25, has been protesting in Colombo nearly every day against what he sees as the incompetence of the Rajapaksa-dominated government.\n“We might have achieved a lot, but we are losing it all right now,” he said. “This family does not know what it is doing, and they’re taking us all down with them.”\nCampaigning for office in 2019, Mr. Rajapaksa promised to restore safety and solvency to a country still reeling after more than 250 people were killed in a series of suicide bombings on Easter Sunday that year. His wartime record gave him credibility.\nAs defense secretary when his brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, was president, he and his family were hailed for ending the country’s civil war in 2009 and for creating an economy that became a model for other nations seeking to rebuild. He benefited from the public outrage over evidence that the government at the time had ignored warnings about the terrorist attacks.\nMr. Rajapaksa won in a landslide election.\nThe atmosphere in Sri Lanka almost immediately shifted. The lead detective for the Criminal Investigations Department, or C.I.D., which had been spearheading investigations into the Rajapaksas, fled to Switzerland. Prominent journalists, diplomats and other security officials rushed to leave.\nTheir fears were not unwarranted. Mr. Rajapaksa has expanded the use of an antiterror law that the European Union and United Nations say has led to “consistent and well-founded allegations” of human rights abuses to jail hundreds of people.\nHejaaz Hizbullah, a prominent Muslim human rights lawyer who challenged Mahinda Rajapaksa’s power grab during a constitutional crisis in 2018, was among them, jailed on charges of hate speech.\nAfter more than a year and a half, Mr. Hizbullah, who denies the charges, received bail in February. He wants to speak for those he says are unfairly incarcerated under the terror law, but fears retaliation.\n“I’m an accused and it’s stifling,” he said.\nMr. Rajapaksa also established a Presidential Commission of Inquiry, a tool that critics say has been used to reverse court judgments, pardon political allies and shield the family from allegations of wartime atrocities. \nShani Abeysakara, the C.I.D. director who worked on the handful of human rights cases that made headway under the previous president, has found himself before the commission more than 40 times.\nIn Mr. Rajapaksa’s first month in office, Mr. Abeysakara was demoted to the personal assistant of a provincial police chief. He was later arrested and jailed on charges of fabricating evidence in the case of a former high-ranking police official close to Gotabaya Rajapaksa who was convicted of murdering a businessman.\nThe police official was acquitted of the charges last March.\nMr. Rajapaksa has also centralized power in the president’s office, giving himself the ability to appoint and dismiss ministers, preside over formerly independent commissions and set economic policy with few checks and balances.\nHe used his newfound powers to turn the Sri Lankan government into something resembling a family firm, appointing his brothers to the most plum ministerial posts: Mahinda as prime minister, and Basil as finance minister. Chamal he made the state (assistant) minister of defense, keeping the top defense post for himself.\nWhen Basil Rajapaksa took the post, Sri Lanka’s economy was already highly leveraged with dollar-denominated debt. It was also running low on dollars to buy essential imports, such as medicine and fuel.\nDespite the challenges, the new government cut taxes and started printing money, hoping to generate local industry. Instead, people spent the extra cash importing cars and other foreign goods. Then, when the pandemic hit, Sri Lanka’s two prime sources of dollars — tourism and remittances from Sri Lankans living abroad — collapsed.\nIn order to save dollars, the government started banning imports.\nIn April 2021, the Rajapaksas declared that Sri Lanka would immediately shift to organic farming, imposing an import ban on fertilizer.\nThe shock — and the condemnation — were swift.\n“There is a saying that a famine comes after an epidemic,” said Muditha Perera, a rice growers’ association president. “However, the famine which is going to occur was invited by the government and not a natural one. This government has deliberately destroyed the country’s agriculture.”\nThe government has received donations from China of rice, a Sri Lankan staple, and paid a premium to import additional supplies of it from Myanmar. \nBasil Rajapaksa acknowledged that the country was “facing a dangerous foreign exchange crisis,” but he ignored economists’ pleas to seek help from the International Monetary Fund. He also refused to answer questions about the country’s balance sheet with members of Sri Lanka’s Parliament, including those from the ruling coalition.\nAs the Sri Lankan currency, the rupee, continued to plunge, the government tried to cap the rising expense of its debt by pegging its currency to the dollar. But that only created a parallel black market where the rupee was worth about two-thirds of the official exchange rate.\nThe Rajapaksa government finally bowed to pressure to let the Sri Lanka rupee float, and it quickly sank. Not even Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s announcement last month that his government was in talks with the I.M.F. for a bailout has helped it recover.\nSri Lanka’s finance ministry on Tuesday suspended payments on about $7 billion in debt, to bondholders, institutions and countries that have lent the country money. Warning of a potential default, the country is trying to negotiate with creditors, and will have trouble borrowing until an I.M.F. agreement is reached.\n“We are getting paid the same as we did before, but everything costs a lot more now,” said 28-year-old Lozaine Pereira, a freelance filmmaker who was among a noisy crowd pushing against the barricades at a protest outside the prime minister’s residence this month. “Just living day to day has become a struggle.”\nAs the protests gain steam across the country, the Rajapaksas are increasingly vulnerable.\nMany of the president’s relatives resigned en masse from their government posts last week, in a seeming effort to appease the protesters. But the demonstrators have continued to gather, setting up tents and portable latrines along an oceanside park in Colombo in preparation for the long haul.\nThe Rajapaksas’ usual hard-line tactics — denouncing opponents and jailing critics — are proving less effective against a spontaneous wave of discontent among a public that is harder to silence.\n“The same people who voted him into power are on the streets asking him to get out,” said Brandon Ingram, a creative director at an ad agency in Colombo who has joined the protests. “So, is he going to leave?”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/12/world/europe/germany-covid-vaccine-strategy.html",
      "text": "BREMEN, Germany — This northern port city, combined with neighboring Bremerhaven, makes up the smallest and by many measures the poorest state in Germany’s federal system. In state comparisons of education or addressing child poverty, it consistently ranks dead last.\nBut when it comes to vaccines, Bremen is No. 1, with more than 90 percent of its population fully vaccinated. It has achieved its success in a country that has managed to vaccinate only slightly more than three-quarters of its people, and that voted last week against a bill that would have made vaccinations mandatory for people 60 and over.\n“Bremen was so successful because they realized pretty early on that you’ve got to go into the neighborhoods, that you can’t just have one central vaccination center, but that you have to go into communities and approach people,” said Marieke Gerstmann, who runs a community health mediation center that advocates for vaccinations in one of Bremen’s poorer neighborhoods.\nWhat makes Bremen’s elite vaccination status all the more striking is that immigrants — who make up one-third of Bremen’s population, the most of any German state — are less likely to get vaccinated than people born in Germany, according to recent studies by the Robert Koch Institute, the national health authority.\n“Our approach was, get to the people and connect with the community,” said Andreas Bovenschulte, who is Bremen’s mayor and also acts as the city-state’s governor.\nMr. Bovenschulte credits a tight network of community elders, religious leaders, civic activists and city employees that was strong in Bremen even before the pandemic hit. Bremen’s social ties are a necessity especially in underprivileged neighborhoods, he said. \nBremen’s chapter of the German Red Cross quickly put together mobile vaccination teams, two brand-new vaccination trucks and nine old city buses — which can serve as mobile vaccination clinics or post-shot recovery rooms.\n“I’ve been preaching this for a while: You have to go and proactively approach people, you have to meet them and explain it to them,” said Melanie Brinkmann, a virologist at the Technische Universität Braunschweig and a member of the expert commission advising the federal government on the coronavirus pandemic.\nBecause so much focus initially was on securing sufficient vaccine doses to cover the population, Germany’s vaccination strategy initially overlooked those who would be harder to reach, Professor Brinkmann said in an interview.\n“The last percentage points are the most difficult,” she said. “But some states really invested in consultations and did it well.”\nOn a recent sunny but bone-chillingly windy morning, one of the colorful vaccination trucks pulled into a desolate parking lot in front of a mall in the hardscrabble neighborhood of Gröpelingen. The truck, furnished with a heater and a noisy coffee maker, was parked next to one of the decommissioned buses that offered a place for the recently vaccinated to rest.\nBülent Aksakal, a community health worker fluent in Turkish and German, had made the rounds in the area the week before, telling people to circle the day on their calendar. Interest was low, because many people had already gotten their shots.\nNajlaa Kanbar, 21, who is from Idlib, Syria, had missed Mr. Aksakal’s entreaties but saw the truck with offers of vaccination written in seven different languages on its side as she walked by with her three young children. She also noticed that there was no line and thought it was the perfect time to get her second shot.\nUnlike other states that did little more than make the vaccines available, several dedicated community organizations in Bremen explained the vaccines and persuaded people to get them.\nA caveat on Bremen’s official 90-percent-plus-coverage figure: Its numbers, like those of other population centers, may be skewed by residents of surrounding communities coming and taking advantage of Bremen’s vaccination offers. Because no national vaccination database exists, it’s hard to know to what extent this added to the numbers in Bremen, for example, or second-place Hamburg.\nMr. Aksakal, the community health worker, said he had spent the last 11 months visiting day care centers, sewing circles, language schools and integration courses, explaining how the vaccine works, why it was important and what side effects could be expected. “Honesty is always the best policy,” he said.\nAs opposed to conspiracy theories, people in immigrant communities “worry more about practical considerations, side effects and bureaucracy,” said Mr. Aksakal.\nIn Bremen-Osterholz, another working-class neighborhood in the eastern part of the city, a team of eight women, all of whom speak at least two languages, try to persuade people to get vaccinated. The community health workers — who are funded by a university — are just a small part of the warren of social workers, nonprofit groups, independent community projects and private people that have been activated to help promote vaccines.\n“There was already a strong network, with many active people raring to go,” said Ms. Gerstmann, who runs the team.\nPatience Bonsu, who was born in Ghana and is one of the counselors, says that when it comes to the often delicate matter of vaccinations, a connection to the relevant migrant community is invaluable.\nAs a counselor at a women’s center, Ms. Bonsu, who speaks English and Twi, a language spoken in Ghana, in addition to German, uses her position to bring up vaccines when talking to the mothers about other issues.\n“The trust issue is very, very important at this moment,” she said.\nWith access to their home communities through social media, many migrants are also exposed to disinformation that leads to fears and questions about vaccination.\n“Many in the African community initially thought the virus wouldn’t affect them because there were so few reported cases in Africa,” said Ms. Bonsu. “But then people from the community here started getting sick.\n“I think that a lot of people, especially from the African community, feel more comfortable asking me questions,” said Ms. Bonsu about her work over the past year.\nThe city’s outreach has gone beyond just explaining vaccinations. Ilker Kabadayi, a mosque elder at the Fatih mosque in Gröpelingen, said he has had local community health workers come in to help explain the Covid social distancing rules.\nNone of it can be taken for granted. Five months after Chancellor Olaf Scholz started pushing for a general vaccine mandate for all adults, lawmakers rejected a watered-down proposal last week. The parliamentary vote was a setback for a country that once prided itself on sound pandemic management, but Bremen is ahead of the game.\nClutching a pack of brochures and smiling at potential vaccine recipients, Sabrine Rehifi stood outside the vaccine truck in Gröpelingen. When it gets busy, it is Ms. Rehifi’s job to help keep the line orderly and make sure everyone has the proper forms; when it’s slow she tries to engage passers-by, which as a speaker of five languages — including Arabic and Swahili — she is well positioned to do.\nWhen Ms. Kanbar approached, Ms. Rehifi greeted her in Arabic. Once she realized that Ms. Kanbar’s German would not suffice to fill out the forms required to get the shot, she accompanied her onboard to translate.\n“By the time they come here, they’ve usually already made up their mind to get their vaccines,” Ms. Rehifi said.\nBut despite the staff’s best effort, Ms. Kanbar’s 2-year-old son started to cry and then wail as the registration went on, which in turn caused his older sister to join in before the staff could bring cookies to to console them.\n“To get downtown with three kids with public transport, that’s actually quite a challenge,” said Peter Zeugträger, who runs the local vaccine operation, over the din. Without the outreach program, Ms. Kanbar might have spent hours traveling to the vaccine center in the central part of the city.\nUnfazed by the wailing, Ms. Kanbar said she was happy to be able to get the shot so easily.\n“My husband will come by as soon as he’s off work,” she said before rolling up her sleeve.",

      "text": "Before boarding his flight from Los Angeles to the Chinese city of Guangzhou, Xue Liangquan, a California-based lawyer, knew he was in for a bit of a headache.\nTo visit his parents in eastern Shandong Province in January, for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began, Mr. Xue, 37, had already shelled out $7,600 for airfare. He had submitted negative test results to the Chinese authorities, as required for entry. Upon arrival, he would have to do three weeks of quarantine.\nEven so, he never could have foreseen just how much of an ordeal he was about to suffer. Mr. Xue, through a Kafka-esque streak of bad luck and run-ins with China’s unbending virus rules, would spend the next three months in quarantine, bouncing between hospitals and hotel rooms.\nReleased from one round of isolation, he would immediately find himself ordered into another. By the time of his return flight, he would have had about two days of freedom in China. He would not have seen his parents at all.\n“It was like a nightmare,” Mr. Xue said in an interview from California, where he returned earlier this month and wrote a blog post on the social media platform WeChat about his experience.\n“I thought, if I didn’t write it down, it would feel even more like a nightmare: As if I had a bad dream in my bed in Los Angeles on Jan. 1, woke up on April 1 and was still in my bed in Los Angeles, and the time in between had just disappeared.”\nChina has for more than two years held to some of the world’s toughest quarantine restrictions, in its unswerving pursuit of “zero Covid.” Wuhan, the city where the pandemic began, was locked down for two months. Shanghai, currently battling its worst Covid outbreak, has been at a standstill for two weeks. International travel to and from China is nearly nonexistent.\nThe restrictions have been a source of much debate, both at home and overseas. Even Mr. Xue’s blog post, which was widely shared on Chinese social media, drew polarizing reactions: Some readers expressed horror, others called it prime material for a comedy movie, and still others attacked Mr. Xue for returning to China at all, decrying it as a selfish decision that risked bringing the virus into the country.\nMr. Xue, who was born in China and moved to the United States seven years ago, remains determinedly neutral.\n“I don’t blame anyone: no person, government, organization,” he said. “I can only blame myself, for having such bad luck.”\nHis ill-fated journey began on Jan. 2, when, armed with a negative Covid test, he took off from Los Angeles. In Guangzhou, he was tested again, then sent to a quarantine hotel. His room was a pleasant surprise — it even had a large Jacuzzi. Perhaps the next few weeks would be like a mini-vacation, he thought.\nIt was not to be. Just as he was about to lie down to rest, he received a phone call informing him that his airport test was positive. He would be transferred to a hospital by ambulance.\nMr. Xue struggled into full-body protective gear that was left at his door. His breath fogged up his glasses and the face covering. “All I could see were the drops of water endlessly dripping down,” he wrote in his blog post.\nHe spent the next four weeks in a hospital, sharing a room with two other patients. He video-chatted with his parents every day, reassuring them that his symptoms were mild. He took photographs of his food to show them that he was eating all right. (In reality, Mr. Xue said, he took photos only of the best meals, so they would not worry.) He worked remotely for the law firm he founded.\nOn Jan. 31, the eve of Lunar New Year — China’s biggest holiday, which he had hoped to spend with his family — he watched the Spring Festival Gala, a televised extravaganza, on his tablet, alone in bed.\nHe had little contact with his fellow patients; no one was really in the mood to socialize, Mr. Xue said.\n“At first, I felt pretty depressed,” he said. “All you can do is suffer. And, within your limited capacity, arrange your daily life as best you can. When you should shower, shower. When you should brush your teeth, brush.”\nOn Feb. 1, he was released from the hospital — and transferred to another one, for recovered patients, for two more weeks of “medical observation.”\nBut even after that, his ordeal was only halfway over.\nAfter leaving the second hospital, Mr. Xue flew to Shanghai, where he had relatives. (He had given up on going to Shandong, as its quarantine rules were stricter than Shanghai’s at the time.) The test he took there, as required by local rules, was negative. For the first time in a month, he was free.\nIt lasted two days. On Feb. 19, Guangzhou health officials notified him that the lone other man with whom he had shared a bus from the last hospital had tested positive. That made Mr. Xue a close contact, meaning he now had to spend 14 days in hotel quarantine.\nThen, on March 6 — the very day he was to be released from that quarantine — he received another call. He himself had now tested positive again, an official told him. Mr. Xue demanded proof, but the official refused, he said.\n“The hardest part for me was the lack of certainty,” he said. “Each time I thought one stage had ended, and I was about to be free, the nightmare would return.”\nAnd so began anew a procedure with which Mr. Xue was now all too familiar. Two more weeks at a medical facility. Two weeks after that at a hotel.\nFinally, on March 31, Mr. Xue was set free, for real. But, exhausted by his ordeal, he had given up hope of seeing his parents and booked an April 1 flight back to the United States. The only relative he saw was his younger brother, in Shanghai.\nOnce, Mr. Xue would have been devastated: Living overseas, he said, he had long cherished, even fixated on, the idea of home. But weeks of isolation had given him a new perspective.\n“We want to go home and reunite, to let our lives that have split apart intersect again. But if we’ve tried, and didn’t succeed, then I don’t have any regrets,” he said. “I still have to be accountable for myself. I can’t, for the sake of this reunion, sacrifice another three months.”\nMr. Xue is sympathetic to China’s controls. The country’s population is so large and so quickly aging, he said, that living with the virus could be disastrous.\nBut he himself will not be trying to return again until restrictions have eased.\n“Otherwise, I think I would still feel sort of traumatized,” he said. “I really am rather scared.”",

      "text": "In recent weeks Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain has revived his fortunes at home by becoming Europe’s most aggressive supporter of Ukraine’s fierce fight against Russian invasion.\nBut on Tuesday Mr. Johnson was battling for his own survival again, after police fined him for attending a lockdown party in Downing Street that broke coronavirus laws made in the very same building.\nMr. Johnson said on Tuesday night that he had paid the fine, though he did not say how much it was, insisting that he would continue in his job despite calls for his resignation, including from the opposition Labour leader. He added: “I once again offer a full apology.”\nThe announcement earlier Tuesday by London’s Metropolitan Police made Mr. Johnson the first holder of his office in living memory to be found in breach of the law, and provoked anger from Britons who obeyed strict coronavirus rules that sometimes even forbade contact with dying relatives.\nIt also prompted opposition politicians to accuse Mr. Johnson of lying to Parliament by denying that breaches of coronavirus rules occurred in Downing Street or other government buildings. That is dangerous territory for Mr. Johnson because, in Britain, ministers are normally expected to resign if they mislead their fellow lawmakers.\nBut the announcement came after several weeks in which Mr. Johnson has stabilized his leadership through robust support for Ukraine’s resistance against Russian military aggression, culminating in his surprise weekend visit to Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.\nThe media’s focus on the war has defused the air of crisis around Downing Street and prompted several internal critics who had made formal demands for a vote of no-confidence in Mr. Johnson to retract them.\nOne of those, Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said on Tuesday that, with conflict raging in Ukraine, “it wouldn’t be right to remove the prime minister at this time.”\nNonetheless the latest twist in the “partygate” saga is an extraordinary development even for Mr. Johnson who has a reputation for extracting himself from crises of his own making.\nIn a statement, London’s Metropolitan Police said it would issue fines for at least 50 breaches of the law as part of its inquiry into the “partygate” scandal that, earlier this year, threatened to sweep Mr. Johnson from power after reports emerged of politicians and officials gathering and drinking in Downing Street and other government buildings despite coronavirus rules.\nThe police did not name any of those to be fined, but the prime minister’s office later said that Mr. Johnson and the chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, had both been notified that they had broken the law.",

      "text": "The mother’s hands were shaking when she started writing on her 2-year-old’s body. They trembled so much that she couldn’t write correctly on her first try, even though the information was second nature: Her daughter’s name, Vira, along with her birth date and their family phone numbers.\n“I thought that if my husband and I died, Vira could find who she is,” the mother, Oleksandra Makoviy, recalled.\nFor Vira, standing in a diaper in their house in Kyiv, the writing on her back was a game. She didn’t know that the bombing had begun.\nMs. Makoviy’s desperate attempt to prepare her daughter for the possibility of being orphaned as the family attempted to escape the Ukrainian capital during the Russian invasion has become a wrenching symbol of the anguish of a nation of parents.\nA photo of Vira’s back that Ms. Makoviy shared on Instagram has been seen hundreds of thousands of times, after it was amplified by Ukrainian journalists and government officials. Messages of support poured in from people all over the world — many Ukrainian parents said they had taken similar action, and others turned the image into art honoring the country’s innocent on social media.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky made a direct reference to efforts like Ms. Makoviy’s in a speech to the Spanish Parliament last week.\n“Just imagine this: mothers in Ukraine write on the backs of their young children,” he said, adding that Russia was destroying “any basis of normal life.”\nThe photo’s wide reach has led some people, particularly on Twitter, to accuse Ms. Makoviy of staging the moment. But she said she shared the photo because she wanted her small audience at the time to feel the “madness” Ukrainian parents were enduring.\nThe start of Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24 left Ms. Makoviy in shock. She described going about the family’s daily routine in a dream-like state, and recalled trying to play with Vira with the sound of bombs in the distance.\nBut Ms. Makoviy, a 33-year-old painter who was born and raised in Kyiv, was also aware that the man-made island they lived on along the Dnipro River had no underground shelter, she said. Visions of the horrors that Russian forces unleashed on the Syrian city of Aleppo flashed in her mind.\nThe family packed their car and drove out of the capital that night.\nBefore they left, Ms. Makoviy scrawled Vira’s information on her back. Vira’s age and inability to understand the situation were a blessing, Ms. Makoviy said. The child inherited a love of art — she liked to draw on her own body — and had no idea of the gravity of what her mother inscribed on her.\nStill, Ms. Makoviy was brought to tears on the drive west by her daughter’s repeated pleas to go home and to see her grandmother, who had given her the teddy bear they brought along and didn’t escape Ukraine until later.\nMs. Makoviy, who could not sleep or keep food down until they crossed the border into Moldova, did not want to lie. “We can’t go home now,” she told her daughter.\nThe family eventually arrived in a village in the south of France, where they have found refuge. Speaking by phone, Ms. Makoviy said she thought that if the worst had happened, Vira might at least be able to look back at her mother’s Instagram, full of everyday moments from their life before the war, and see that she had been surrounded with love.\nAfter their journey, Vira has physical reminders of that love as well — several volunteers on their route gifted her teddy bears. Along with the bear from her grandmother, who is traveling from Poland to reunite with her, she has amassed a small collection.",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/world/europe/un-security-council-russia-ukraine.html",
      "text": "President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is set to give one of his most high-profile speeches since the war began when he addresses the United Nations Security Council by video-link on Tuesday.\nWith three permanent members of the Security Council — Britain, France and the United States — firmly in his corner, Mr. Zelensky was expected to make the case that Russian forces have committed war crimes, as evidence emerges of civilian killings in the suburbs of Kyiv.\nBut Russia and its ally China are also permanent members of the council, holding veto power over any measures it might take. Ten nonpermanent members also have a say: Albania, Brazil, Gabon, Ghana, India, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico, Norway and the United Arab Emirates.\nHere’s what you need to know ahead of the meeting:\nThe 15-nation Security Council is the most powerful U.N. body. Its responsibility is to protect and maintain international peace, and it has the power to enforce decisions that member states are obligated to follow under the U.N. Charter.\nOnce a threat to peace is brought before the council, the first step is to push for a resolution by “peaceful means,” which includes investigations, mediation or appointing a special envoy. If the threat is not resolved, economic sanctions, the severance of diplomatic relations, travel bans, collective military action and arms embargoes are among the last measures the Council can enforce. The Council can also dispatch peacekeeping forces.\nIt is unlikely the council will agree on any measures against Russia, as Russia is almost certain to veto any resolution on Ukraine as a permanent council member. But Mr. Zelensky is likely to demand that allies supply his county with more weapons and further isolate President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.\nThe meeting will be a prominent venue for the nations aligned with Ukraine to make impassioned pleas and for Russia to issue sharp denials of atrocities.\nIn February, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations vetoed a Security Council resolution written by the United States and its allies that condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, used his speech to criticize the United States for invading Iraq in 2003.\nChina, an increasingly important Russian ally, has avoided any criticism of Russia since the war started and has painted Russia as a long-suffering victim of the West. In the council vote in February, it abstained, while calling on Western nations to listen to Russia’s concerns.\nAmong the 10 rotating members, Brazil and Gabon also have close ties to Russia. President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil flew to Moscow right before the invasion, and has taken a position of neutrality on the war. Gabon, one of Africa’s largest oil producers, has ties with Russia dating back to the Soviet Union.\nIreland and Norway are likely to join other Western democracies in backing Ukraine. Ghana has deep ties with the United States and will also likely support the Western position.\nIndia has tried to maintain relations with Russia while not antagonizing the United States, and its position in the conflict has been harder to discern. In February, India invoked its decades-old ties with Russia when it voted to abstain from the Security Council resolution. The United Arab Emirates, a U.S. ally in the Middle East, also abstained in February’s vote.",

      "headline": "At Least 200 Feared Dead in Apartments Hit by Russia, Officials Say",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/world/asia/ukraine-civilians-russia-borodyanka.html",
      "text": "BORODYANKA, Ukraine — Andreiy Ziuzko stood near the flattened apartment complex in Borodyanka that was once his home, his belongings in plastic bags on the sidewalk beside a few blackened cooking pots on Tuesday.\nThe building had lain in ruins for weeks, struck just after fighting had driven him and his family to flee. It was only after a while that he explained something even worse had happened. His mother lived a few doors down, and her apartment had also been bombed.\n“Mom’s home was hit on the same day,” Mr. Ziuzko said. “I can’t find her.”\nRussian troops recently withdrew from the area around Borodyanka, a Ukrainian commuter town near Kyiv, the capital, that was among the first places to be hit by Russian airstrikes after the invasion. Now, dozens of people who were sheltering in basements or apartments are missing and presumed dead under the rubble, the acting mayor said Tuesday.\n“We think over 200 people died,” said Georgii Yerko, the acting mayor of Borodyanka. “But it is an assumption.”\nOn Tuesday, New York Times journalists reached the town for the first time after Russian troops withdrew. The scars left behind were shocking, with great gashes sliced through multistory complexes along the main street. Four apartment buildings had collapsed in the bombing, residents said, their floors crushed down to ground level like concertinas. Heavy fighting left more destruction for two miles along the main street.\nRussia’s pullout from areas around Kyiv in recent days has unveiled evidence of abuses that have galvanized the world’s attention. In places like Bucha, a closer-in suburb of the capital just a few miles from Borodyanka, the focus has been on evidence that Ukrainian civilians were killed by Russian forces, including bodies whose hands had been bound and who had been shot at close range.\nIn Borodyanka, and other places, the focus has been on evidence that civilian buildings were indiscriminately targeted. The topic was central in discussions at the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday.\nRosemary DiCarlo, the U.N. chief for political and peace-building affairs, told the Security Council that explosive weapons had caused death and destruction in many populated areas, wrecking infrastructure that included residential buildings, hospitals, schools, water stations and electricity systems.\nThe U.N. received credible allegations that Russia had used cluster munitions — banned weapons that spew small explosive mines across a wide space — in populated areas at least 24 times, Ms. DiCarlo said. She added that there were accusations that Ukrainian forces had also used cluster munitions.\n“Indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes,” Ms. DiCarlo told the council.\nBorodyanka used to have about 13,000 residents, and the town — a simple, modest place, as one resident described it — was built along a highway crossroads. That convergence was a selling point for people who worked in Kyiv, just a short drive away to the southeast, and for Russian troops as well as their convoys that began piling into the country’s north to try to seal off the capital in the last days of February.\nResidents said that the Russian forces began filing through the town around Feb. 27, and that volunteers with the Ukrainian territorial defense forces then attacked one of the convoys. After that, Russian soldiers started shooting at cars and buildings as they drove through town, said Valerii Vishnyak, a resident. “It was just lawlessness,” he said.\nThen, late on March 1, Russian jets came screaming overhead. “We were sitting in the cellar,” said Tamara Vishnyak, Mr. Vishnyak’s mother. “The plane flew very low. I counted three seconds and the bomb fell.” The bomb crashed through the building across the street.\nMr. Ziuzko, 43, said that the only reason he and his family escaped the airstrikes was because they had fled their nearby building when the fighting set it on fire.\nHe said he did not know where his mother, Svetlana Ziuzko, 66, had been at the time the bombs hit, whether in her apartment or in the bomb shelter. His voice catching, he said he could not remember what day it was the last time he saw her.\n“The back of the building is gone; just the balcony is there,” he said, pointing to the sixth-floor balcony hanging above a vacuum.\nBehind the building, two women stood watch while their husbands climbed down into the basement next to the destroyed section. Tanya Hachnikova, 36, said her husband was trying to find his parents, who lived in the apartment building. The second woman, Oksana Dikan, 43, was looking for a colleague who lived there and was also missing.\nThey said they thought up to 20 people had been living in the building when it was hit, but the two men climbed back out saying they could not get through to the basement that lay under the rubble. “We need help, and we need equipment,” Ms. Dikan said later by telephone.\nMany people fled the town to escape the fighting that raged there for days, until a sustained Ukrainian counterattack led Russian troops to pull out last week. Mr. Yerko, the acting mayor, said that digging for bodies would have to wait. The first task, he said, was to reconnect the electricity and remove unexploded ordinance and then clear the rubble.\nYaroslav, an information technology specialist who asked that only his first name be published to avoid being identified, was climbing on to a bench to look into a gutted apartment he said belonged to his parents. They had left, with just their documents and their cat, the day before the bomb fell on the building, he said. Almost certainly there were people still living in their apartments and hiding in the shelter when the airstrike hit, he said.\nAsked if the Ukrainian military had been using the building, he said no. “What army? My parents were living there.”",

      "text": "Perhaps it was the way the lifeless bodies, bloodied by bullets, and some with hands bound, had been left strewn about or shoveled into makeshift mass graves. Or the reality of seeing them up close in widely circulated photographs and videos.\nThere have been other atrocities in the weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, concentrating much of its firepower on the dwellings and gathering spots of ordinary Ukrainians, but the international outrage they provoked has been eclipsed by the reaction to revelations that retreating Russian soldiers left many slain civilians behind near the Ukrainian capital.\nSome of the bodies found this past weekend outside Kyiv were face down, and some curled up. Civilians appear to have been killed on their bicycles, while walking down the street, or in the basements of homes. In Bucha, where many of the dead were discovered, three bodies were found in a garden.\nMany of the victims had been shot in the head. A coroner in Bucha said his team had collected dozens. The Russians fired at anyone as their tanks rolled through the town in the war’s early days, some residents said.\nRussian officials denied responsibility, dismissing the photographs of bodies as fabricated, but satellite images taken during the Russian occupation of Bucha and other towns belied their claims.\nAn analysis of the satellite images by The New York Times showed dots in the exact coordinates where the bodies were later found in the newly liberated areas by Ukrainian forces and journalists. That corroborated the accounts of witnesses who said many had lain there for weeks.\nThe summary killings of civilians add to the growing body of evidence of numerous flagrant violations by Russian forces of the laws of war, as described in the Geneva Conventions and the International Criminal Court’s definitions of what constitutes a war crime.\nProsecutors in war-crime cases have a steep hill to climb. But experts in international law say the distressing images of civilians shot to death in Bucha and other towns vacated by the Russians, along with the accounts of eyewitnesses, could provide a trove of documentation for investigations.\nUnlike other horrors of the Ukraine war, like the bombing of a maternity hospital, the flattening of a theater where people were sheltering, or the shelling of apartment houses, the killings in Bucha could not be cast as unintentional damage or easily denied by the Russians as propaganda.\n“What’s different here is that you have images of civilians with their hands bound and executed — that’s a completely different kind of crime,” said Alex Whiting, a visiting professor at Harvard Law School who has worked on international war crimes prosecutions. “This very much looks like a crime.”\nRachel Denber, deputy director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch, which has been gathering evidence of war crimes in Ukraine, said the killings have generated so much shock in part because many of the other civilian deaths in the war have been caused by indiscriminate shelling and bombing — although that is no less an atrocity.\n“I think one of the reasons people are having a different reaction to these bodies on the ground is the suspicion that these victims weren’t indiscriminate, they were deliberate,” she said.\nWhen Russia began the invasion on Feb. 24, there were widespread expectations that its superior strength would quickly subjugate Ukraine. But when they met fierce Ukrainian resistance, the Russians soon resorted to large-scale bombings and missile barrages, making little or no distinction between civilian and military targets, and leveling all or parts of some cities and towns.\nIn some ways, legal experts said, the imagery of civilians shot at close range conveys a more personal malevolence.\n“I suppose at one level, one sees a town destroyed, one thinks this sort of thing happens in war,” said Andrew Clapham, a professor of international law at the Geneva Graduate Institute, who is among those advising Ukraine’s government. “People sort of suspend their horror and say it might be explicable in wartime.”\nBut the deaths outside Kyiv, he said, showed an intent to kill civilians.\n“It’s much more obvious that there’s no excuse,” Mr. Clapham said.\nHere is a geographical breakdown of where some of the worst atrocities in the war in Ukraine have been reported:\nThe southeast port, one of the first targets of the Russian invasion, has been under siege for weeks, with little food, water or power, and its onetime population of 450,000 has by some estimates shrunk to 100,000 or less. A March 9 missile strike by Russia severely damaged a maternity hospital, leaving an undetermined number of casualties. A March 16 Russian bombing destroyed the Mariupol Drama Theater, where hundreds of civilians had sought shelter and where the word “children” had been written in large letters outside to dissuade aerial attackers. Ukrainian officials said 300 people inside were killed. On March 21, Ukrainian officials said the Russians had moved up to 4,500 Mariupol residents into Russian territory — which, if confirmed as a forced relocation, would be a potential war crime.\nThe city of 1.5 million in eastern Ukraine, the country’s second largest, has been subjected to Russian aerial attacks from missiles, artillery and cluster munitions, widely banned weapons that spread bomblets over a wide area. According to residents and videos verified by The New York Times, the Kharkiv destruction has included elementary schools and residences. Ukrainian officials recently estimated that at least 500 people had been killed. And Human Rights Watch, in a report Sunday on potential war crimes in Ukraine, said it had documented at least one instance of rape by Russian soldiers in the Kharkiv region on March 13.\nThe northern city near the border with Belarus was a temporary haven for many civilians who sought to escape Russia’s early drive to encircle Kyiv. But Russian forces subjected Chernihiv to relentless aerial assaults as well, after Ukrainian defenders prevented the invaders from taking that city. Witnesses in Chernihiv said the Russian attacks destroyed schools, damaged hospitals and hit civilians waiting in bread lines.\nThe southern industrial city of 500,000, which blocks the Russian military’s pathway to the Black Sea port of Odesa, has withstood several Russian advances and aerial attacks. One destroyed a marine military barracks that killed dozens, others were more indiscriminate. Missile assaults have slammed into residential apartment buildings. And last week, a missile strike hit a government building, killing at least 36 people. Over the weekend and on Monday, other deadly attacks were reported on vehicles and homes in and around the city.\nMany bodies of civilians have been found in suburbs north of Kyiv. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said on Monday in his nightly address that more than 300 had been tortured and killed in Bucha alone, and that the list was likely to grow. In its report on Sunday, Human Rights Watch chronicled the summary execution of one Bucha man on March 4 by Russian soldiers and the killing of a mother and her 14-year-old daughter in another northern town, Vorzel, a few days later.\nSexual violence by the Russian occupiers has also been reported. Last month, Ukraine’s prosecutor-general, Iryna Venediktova, said in a Facebook post that a Russian soldier had killed an unarmed civilian and then repeatedly raped his wife in a Kyiv suburb. \nLaura A. Dickinson, a professor at George Washington University Law School who specializes in international law, said the photographs of bodies in the Kyiv suburbs offered some of the most compelling signs that atrocities have been committed by the Russian side, regardless of the Kremlin’s denials.\n“The evidence is quite damning, I would say,” she said. “It’s hard to dismiss as fake.”",

      "headline": "Stolen Darwin Notebooks, Missing for Decades, Are Returned",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/world/europe/charles-darwin-notebooks-cambridge-library.html",
      "text": "Twenty-two years after a pair of notebooks filled with Charles Darwin’s early musings went missing from the Cambridge University Library, they were anonymously returned in good condition last month along with a note to the elated librarian: “Happy Easter.”\n“Happy” scarcely begins to describe the reaction of Jessica Gardner, the university librarian who spearheaded an international publicity blitz in 2020 to recover the notebooks. Filled with Darwin’s scrawled handwriting and sketches from 1837, including the famous “tree of life” drawing, the notebooks recorded his thought process as he began sketching out ideas that would later develop into world-famous theories still revered and studied today, including the theory of natural selection.\nOn March 9, outside her office in an area of the library with no cameras, someone placed a bright pink gift bag. Dr. Gardner and her colleagues first recognized the original blue box that had been taken from the archives. Then, inside a brown envelope, they found the notebooks they had long sought inside tightly wrapped cling wrap, along with the typed note wishing her a Happy Easter.\n“I still feel shaky,” she said in an interview on Tuesday, when the university announced that the notebooks had been recovered. “It’s really hard to express how overjoyed I am.”\nAfter waiting a few days — the police, who are continuing an investigation, instructed the university to wait before removing the notebooks from the plastic wrap — the university’s conservation experts delicately unsheathed them. Along with a team of experts, they looked through every page of both books, searching for damage or missing pages.\nJim Secord, the director of the university’s Darwin Correspondence Project, which has assembled the scientist’s writings, was among those who handled the notebooks, having also handled them in the 1990s before they went missing. He said it was immediately apparent that they were genuine, and that they had been kept in good condition with no missing pages.\nForgery was not a concern, he said — it would have been far too difficult to forge the several types of ink, the aged paper or the clasps on the leather binding, let alone the box it came in from the archives.\n“There’s no question, I think, they are the real notebooks,” he said.\nThe notebooks had been held in the library’s Special Collections Strong Rooms, where the rarest and most valuable items in its collection are stored. They were taken out to be photographed in September 2000. During a routine check a month later, the small box that contained the two notebooks was found to be missing, the library said. Years of fruitless searching led the library and national experts in cultural heritage theft to conclude that they had most likely been stolen.\nThe return of the notebooks brings relative closure to the academics eager to bring them home to the university’s treasured collection of Darwin’s correspondence. But it has done little to settle the many mysteries that remain: how the notebooks went missing, who took them, what happened in those 22 years, and why they were returned now.\nThe police in Cambridgeshire said in a statement that the investigation remained open, adding that “we share the university’s delight that these priceless notebooks are now back where they belong.”\nThere’s no way to know what prompted someone to hand back the notebooks. But Dr. Gardner said she believed the public appeal for information in 2020, which prompted worldwide media coverage, including an article in The New York Times, could have been a factor. Perhaps someone’s conscience was pricked.\nGetting the notebooks back at any point would have been a joy, but Dr. Gardner was particularly pleased that they can now be included in an exhibition starting in July. The exhibition, “Darwin in Conversation,” will come to the New York Public Library in spring 2023.\n“Charles Darwin means so much to people around the world,” Dr. Gardner said. The university’s archive includes thousands of his letters, but “these two are so important,” she said.\nThe contents of the notebooks had long been digitized, so scholars could still study his words and images even when the books themselves were missing.\nBut Mr. Secord said that they contained “unparalleled insight into how an individual comes up with a discovery,” and that there was incalculable value to seeing the physical objects. Imagining Darwin scribbling in a grubby book, one that would have been readily available at stationery stores across London at the time, reflects how ordinary settings can give rise to enormous thought, he said.\n“I do think they help to make the discoveries real and concrete,” he said, “and I think for us that’s really important to see.”",

      "headline": "Some Ukrainian Refugees Are Returning Home, Despite the Risks",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/world/europe/ukraine-refugee-war-return.html",
      "text": "LVIV, Ukraine — From her bearing and demeanor, the college instructor waiting at the Lviv bus station appeared to be accustomed to respect and, judging by her fur-trimmed coat and pink mohair hat adorned with a sparkling pin, used to a certain elegance.\nBut after two weeks on the road as a refugee with her daughter and 1-year-old grandson, she had had enough.\nIn Poland and the Czech Republic, Oksana, who did not want to give her last name, said she was just another refugee in a shelter who did not speak the language.\n“Nobody needs us,” she said. “Nobody needs teachers. Knowing the Czech language is obligatory. They would be ready to take me as a cleaning lady, but even then I would need to find a place to live.”\nNow she and her family were joining the growing number of Ukrainians who were returning home.\nFor the first time since the Russian invasion six weeks ago, an increasing number of travelers coming through the western Ukrainian city of Lviv and other transit hubs are returning home rather than fleeing.\nThere are still far more citizens leaving their homes. But according to travelers and officials, the surge in returnees reflects a growing belief that the war could last years, and a willingness to live with a measure of danger rather than live as a refugee in another country, bereft of home and community.\nIt also highlights the difficulties European countries have had providing for Ukrainians in the continent’s biggest refugee crisis since World War II.\n“The statistics have changed a lot recently,” Yurii Buchko, the deputy military administrator for Lviv, said in an interview. “In the beginning of the war 10 times the number of people left as those who returned.” Now, he said, on some days half of those crossing the border in Lviv Province were returning home rather than leaving.\nThe returnees are largely women and children. Most Ukrainian men of military age with fewer than three children were banned from leaving the country at the start of the war. At the border with Poland, virtually all the drivers of civilian cars crossing the border are women. The trains and bus stations are packed with women and children.\n“People have now understood what war is like and that even with war, you can stay and live in Ukraine, in Lviv,” Mr. Buchko said. “They left at the beginning because of the panic, but they have family members still here.”\nHe said Ukrainians were also returning to go back to work as more shops and businesses reopened.\nOn Saturday, a fairly typical day, 18,000 Ukrainians left the country, while 9,000 crossed back again through border posts in his province, he said. He said that while some were traders transporting goods, many were Ukrainian families intending to go home. Figures from Ukraine’s border guard confirm the trend.\nMore than four million Ukrainians have fled the country since the war began, and more than seven million have fled their homes but remained in Ukraine.\nMany who stayed in the country had evacuated to Lviv and to other cities and towns closer to the Polish border, which were thought to be safer than cities in the south and east.\nRecent rocket attacks in Lviv, including on a military training base and an oil installation, killed several dozen people but for the most part the city has remained untouched.\nTravelers and officials said that some people were returning to the capital, Kyiv, because of the Russian retreat there.\nAt Lviv’s ornate century-old train station, Valeria Yuriivna stood on the platform about to board a train to Mykolaiv, which remains under heavy fire from Russian airstrikes. Her 14-year-old daughter and their dog were already on the train. Her eldest daughter was waiting for her at home in Mykolaiv.\nMs. Yuriivna, a government employee, said they had been terrified by Russian shelling, which shook their apartment building. But she said it had been difficult staying with friends in Lviv with her daughter and dog for an entire month.\n“They have been bombing hospitals in Mykolaiv,” she said. “They need people to help, to cover the windows with blast film. I am going back to volunteer.”\nShe and others said they were worried that something would happen to the railway, preventing them from getting home.\nWhen an air-raid siren sounded at the train station late Monday night, a crush of travelers headed underground to await the all-clear sign: weary mothers dragging suitcases while holding crying children, city dwellers with small dogs in their arms, an opera singer returning from a concert in Poland.\nMost of the frequent air-raid sirens in this historic city mark the presence of Russian fighter jets heading for targets in eastern Ukraine.\nYurii Savchuck, a conductor, directed passengers to their train cars. A medical team ran frantically up the stairs carrying a frail older woman in a wheelchair, rushing to get her on the train in time.\n“For the last couple of days more people have been going home,” said Mr. Savchuck, a 20-year veteran of the Ukrainian railroad. “Not everyone has the money to stay abroad for long. Also Kyiv was liberated and people want to see if their houses are destroyed.”\nAt the headquarters of Lviv’s military administration, Mr. Buchko and his staff emerged from a bunker after the latest all-clear. More than a month into the war, the sirens were so routine that employees were sitting on benches chatting, sharing jokes and talking on their phones. He and other officials were making plans to reopen more businesses so more Ukrainians could return and get back to work.\n“At the beginning of the war, we were understanding or hoping that this war would last for a week or probably a few days,” he said “Right now we see that it’s going to last not for months probably, but for several years. And we have to live with that.”\nAt the bus station on Sunday, Oksana and her family were trying to find a taxi to the train station to go to their home to Dnipro, in eastern Ukraine, despite the fact that it has recently been hit by Russian missiles. But life as a refugee seemed worse.\n“We were roaming for more than two weeks,” Oksana said. “From Poland to the Czech Republic then back to Poland and then here.”\n“We were staying in a small center in the Czech Republic,” said her daughter Halyna, who is also a college instructor. “You need to do everything for yourself and everything is in Czech so you can’t understand it.”\nIn Poland they moved into a hotel after living in a shelter for two days but then ran out of money.\n“It was difficult,” Halyna said. “Everyone was in the same room. Poland especially was very helpful with food and other things but we had no place to live.”\nOthers arriving by bus from Poland said the Poles had been very welcoming but were overwhelmed by the number of people arriving.\n“Everyone there wants to come home,” Oksana said.",

      "headline": "What are war crimes, and how are they prosecuted?",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/world/europe/war-crimes-russia-ukraine.html",
      "text": "World leaders have vowed to hold President Vladimir V. Putin responsible for war crimes as evidence mounts that Russian forces killed civilians in Ukraine.\nThe Kremlin has denied the allegations and says that recent images from the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, which was liberated from Russian control in the past week, were staged. But President Biden has called him a war criminal. And President Volodymyr Zelensky has said Mr. Putin is responsible for genocide.\nIf past prosecutions of war crimes are any indication, the process is arduous and thorough, and takes years of investigations and litigation that are only decided decades after a conflict ends.\nHere’s what you need to know:\nA war crime is an act committed during armed conflict that violates international humanitarian laws designed to protect civilians. The rules of war are codified in various treaties, including the Geneva Convention of 1949 and the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907.\nThe primary entity that can hold individuals accountable for war crimes is the International Criminal Court. It was established in 2002 through a treaty known as the Rome Statute that lists actions that can be prosecuted as war crimes, including willful killings, torture and intentional attacks on civilians. Some cases have been brought before special tribunals created by the United Nations.\nUkraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said the bodies of 410 people, apparently all civilians, have been recovered from the Kyiv region. Human Rights Watch said it had documented cases of rape, executions and looting of civilian property.\nThe New York Times has reported accounts of indiscriminate killings, torture and other violence against civilians. The I.C.C. had already launched a criminal investigation of possible war crimes in early March.\n“What they did in Bucha, or the bombing of a hospital or a school, those are prima facie war crimes,” said Kwon O-Gon, an expert on international law who served as a judge on the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\nWar crimes are investigated as any criminal activity would be, through interviewing witnesses, reviewing photos or videos and collecting forensic evidence, including ballistics analysis, autopsies or DNA testing. Prosecutors need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that individuals knowingly committed the crimes.\nTougher to prove is how much a head of state knew and or was directly responsible for what happened under their command.\nThe I.C.C. does not have its own police force or military. The court is reliant on states to hand over its owns citizens to the court for prosecution. That’s unlikely to happen with Russia’s high-level officials, much less Mr. Putin.\nMr. Kwon noted there are no statutes of limitations for war crimes. Evidence or insider information could emerge years later, and Putin or others could be handed over to the court to ultimately be held accountable.\n“Even if it takes 10 years or 20 years, even if it’s after Putin is removed from power, he could be brought to the dock,” Mr. Kwon said.\nSlobodan Milosevic, known as the “Butcher of the Balkans,” was the first former head of state to be tried for such crimes in 2002. He died in his cell in The Hague as his four-year trial drew to a close, before a verdict was reached.\nCharles G. Taylor, the former president of Liberia, was sentenced to 50 years in 2012 for atrocities committed in Sierra Leone during its civil war in the 1990s. Laurent Gbagbo, former president of Ivory Coast, was acquitted of crimes against humanity and other charges related to violence that followed the country’s presidential election in 2010.\nThe I.C.C. issued an arrest warrant for Libya’s leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, in 2011 accusing him of crimes against humanity, but he was killed that October before he faced trial.\nFormer President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan is wanted by the court on charges of genocide and war crimes in the Darfur region, but he has not been turned over by Sudan’s transitional government.",

      "headline": "Jewish Man’s Death Near Paris Fuels Outrage on Election Eve",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/world/europe/jewish-death-france-election.html",
      "text": "PARIS — When Jérémy Cohen, 31, a Jewish man living in a northern suburb of Paris, died in February after being hit by a tram, his death was initially reported as an accident and garnered little attention.\nBut the episode set off outrage this week after a video surfaced on social media showing that Mr. Cohen, who was identified by prosecutors, had been fleeing a beating by a group of young men when he crossed the tram tracks — raising suspicions that an antisemitic assault had precipitated his death and turning it into a political flashpoint just days before France’s presidential election.\nCandidates entering the final stretch of the presidential campaign are now rushing to demand clarity on the exact circumstances of Mr. Cohen’s death, injecting new volatility into an already close race.\nProsecutors have opened an assault and involuntary manslaughter investigation and, while not ruling it out, have said there is no evidence so far of an antisemitic motive. But no arrests have been made, and the authorities have not yet established why Mr. Cohen was attacked.\nPoliticians on the far-right have been most vocal about the case — especially Éric Zemmour, the anti-immigrant pundit whose campaign has flagged in recent weeks and who has brushed over the case’s unknowns to depict France as a crime-ridden country. He has vowed that his first symbolic gesture as president would be to visit Mr. Cohen’s family.\nBut the case also echoed longstanding frustration in the French Jewish community that antisemitism and attacks against Jews are often minimized or mishandled by France’s media and authorities.\n“I expect the justice system to shed all of the light on his death and to explore all leads, including widening the legal proceedings to include antisemitism,” Francis Kalifat, the president of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France, said on Twitter.\nGérald Cohen, Mr. Cohen’s father, told BFMTV on Monday that he had reached out to Mr. Zemmour in hopes of publicizing the death and speeding up the investigation. Mr. Zemmour is Jewish, although his rise — propelled by attempts to rehabilitate France’s Vichy regime, which collaborated with the Nazis during World War II — has split France’s Jewish community.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron told reporters during a campaign stop in Brittany, in western France, on Tuesday that he wanted “full clarity” about Mr. Cohen’s death, but cautioned against “political manipulations.”\nMr. Macron is still widely expected to make it past the first round of voting on Sunday, but the latest polls show that his lead in a potential runoff against Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader, is dwindling.\nIn a sign of how seriously he was treating the investigation into Mr. Cohen’s death, Mr. Macron’s office said that he had asked the justice minister to closely monitor the case and to keep him “personally informed” about it.\nIn 2017, weeks before Mr. Macron’s election, a 65-year-old Jewish woman, Sarah Halimi, was thrown out of her window by a man who had smoked cannabis. But it took until 2021 for France’s highest court to rule that the man couldn’t stand trial for her death because it determined he was in a state of acute mental delirium brought on by his drug consumption, prompting widespread outrage. Mr. Macron himself had called for a trial in the case, which is emblematic of the Jewish community’s frustration with France’s legal system.\nMr. Zemmour, who describes France as besieged by Islam and immigration, was the first to bring national attention to Mr. Cohen’s case in several Twitter posts on Monday. He followed up with a scathing opinion article in Valeurs Actuelles, a conservative publication, calling Mr. Cohen’s death a “horrendous symptom of the tragedy that our country is experiencing.”\nOther candidates across the spectrum quickly reacted in Mr. Zemmour’s wake.\nMs. Le Pen wrote on Twitter that “what was presented as an accident could be an antisemitic murder,” while Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the far-left candidate in the presidential election, expressed support for Mr. Cohen’s family and asked for “truth and justice.”\nIn the days and weeks after the incident, two of Mr. Cohen’s brothers appealed to people living near the scene of the assault for information, putting fliers in mailboxes. Someone reached out with a video of the incident, which was also shared with the police. It is unclear who initially posted the video on social media, but it gained prominence after Mr. Zemmour shared it.\nThat footage of the Feb. 16 assault was filmed at a distance, seemingly by an onlooker in a nearby building. It shows about a dozen young men surrounding Mr. Cohen in front of a building entrance on a busy street in Bobigny, a northern suburb of Paris, at around 8 p.m. Several of them appear to push, shove or hit Mr. Cohen, who falls to the ground.\nAnother figure then joins the group and starts violently punching him. Mr. Cohen flees and crosses the street onto the tracks and is hit by the tram, trapped in its undercarriage. Mr. Cohen died several hours later in the hospital.\nÉric Mathais, the prosecutor in Bobigny, said at a news conference on Tuesday that investigators were questioning witnesses but had not yet determined what had motivated the assault or whether Mr. Cohen had been targeted because he was Jewish. But he said that any new evidence of an antisemitic motive would be taken into account.\nMr. Cohen had a white skullcap that police later returned to his family after finding it near the scene of the incident, but it was unclear whether he was wearing it at the time of the assault, according to prosecutors and Mr. Cohen’s family.\nMr. Cohen’s father said his son was a “kind” man who had studied math and computer science after high school and was “pulling his life back together” after experiencing depression.\n“They hit, hit and hit him, but he never defended himself,” Mr. Cohen said of his son, adding that, for him, “the tramway was the result of everything that happened before.”",

      "headline": "Zelensky Accuses Russia of Atrocities and Criticizes U.N.’s Inaction",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/world/europe/zelensky-un-security-council.html",
      "text": "With evidence mounting of atrocities in the Kyiv suburbs, and Russian forces preparing for a new offensive farther east, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine delivered a scathing speech to the United Nations on Tuesday, accusing Russia of a litany of horrors and questioning whether a world body that takes no action to stop a war serves any purpose.\nSpeaking via video link to the U.N. Security Council, he compared Russian forces to the Islamic State, called for a Nuremberg-like war crimes tribunal and vented his bitter frustration, knowing that the council — where Russia is one of five permanent members with veto power — would do nothing but talk.\n“Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee?” Mr. Zelensky said, raising the question of whether Russia deserved to keep its seat on the council. “Are you ready to close the U.N.? Do you think that the time of international law is gone? If your answer is no, then you need to act immediately.”\nThe chamber fell silent as a short video provided by Mr. Zelensky’s government played, showing some of the hundreds of corpses found strewn around the city of Bucha, northwest of Kyiv, after Russian forces retreated last week — bloated, charred bodies of civilians, including children. Some victims, their hands bound, had been shot in the head.\nMr. Zelensky said that in Bucha, “they killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies.” Civilians “were crushed by tanks while sitting in their cars in the middle of the road,” he added, asserting that “women were raped and killed in front of their children; their tongues were pulled out.”\nChina refrained from criticizing Russia in Tuesday’s session, saying that the Security Council should wait until investigations establish the facts in Ukraine. A rising global power, China has drawn closer to Russia in recent years, united by a shared antipathy to the United States. The divisions on the war appeared essentially unchanged since Feb. 26, when 11 of 15 Security Council members voted for a resolution condemning Russia’s invasion, Russia vetoed the measure, and three others abstained — China, India and the United Arab Emirates.\nRussia’s U.N. ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, reiterated his government’s claims — rebutted by ample evidence — that atrocities in Bucha had been faked, or had not occurred when Russians held the city. He made a number of other unsupported claims, including stating falsely that in Ukraine — where the freely elected president is a Jew who lost family members in the Holocaust — Nazis are “running the show.”\nAfter President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia launched the war on Ukraine on Feb. 24, his military became bogged down on several fronts in the face of logistical failures and unexpectedly fierce Ukrainian resistance. Russian forces spent weeks shelling and occupying cities and towns in northern Ukraine, where they took heavy losses as they failed to capture Kyiv, the capital. Last week they pulled back from that part of the country, preparing for what Russian officials and foreign analysts said would be a shift in focus toward eastern Ukraine.\n“The next pivotal battle of the war” is likely to be for the eastern city of Sloviansk, according to a report released on Tuesday by the Institute for the Study of War, based in Washington.\nRevulsion over the apparent executions discovered in Bucha deepened Russia’s economic isolation, despite its denials of responsibility.\nThe United States has started blocking Russia from making debt payments using dollars held in American banks, a move designed to deplete its international currency reserves and potentially push Russia toward its first foreign currency debt default in a century.\nAnd as early as Wednesday, the Biden administration is expected to announce additional sanctions against Russia for the killings of Ukrainian citizens, according to a person familiar with the plans who was not authorized to detail them publicly. The administration will expand existing sanctions against Sberbank, the largest financial institution in Russia, and implement sanctions against Alfa Bank, one of the country’s largest private lenders. The administration also plans to announce sanctions against adult children of Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president.\nThe Biden administration has also authorized an additional shipment of up to $100 million in military supplies that will be taken from existing Defense Department stockpiles, the Pentagon announced in an email sent to reporters Tuesday night. This comes days after an additional $300 million in defense aid was announced April 1.\nAnd the European Union took a significant step toward overcoming resistance to curbing fuel imports from Russia, on which its member nations rely heavily. The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, proposed cutting off imports of Russian coal — oil and natural gas remain hotly debated — and barring Russian vessels from E.U. ports as part of a new round of sanctions.\nThe measures, which require unanimous approval, are expected to go to a vote of E.U. ambassadors on Wednesday. Diplomats said the sanctions package would target, among others, two daughters of Mr. Putin. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the chief E.U. diplomat, Josep Borrell Fontelles, announced plans to visit Kyiv this week and meet with Mr. Zelensky.\nThe Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office said that it, along with the Kyiv police, had discovered what it called a Bucha “torture chamber,” where Russian forces had left behind the bodies of five men, their hands tied, who had been tortured and killed.\nMr. Zelensky reinforced a point that U.N. officials have made repeatedly: The true extent of Ukraine’s destruction and casualties is unknown but far greater than what has been documented, because outside observers have been unable to reach some of the most devastated areas. “Now the world can see what Russia did in Bucha, but the world has yet to see what it has done in other parts of our country,” Mr. Zelensky said.\nNew York Times journalists on Tuesday were able for the first time to reach the town of Borodyanka, northwest of Kyiv, battered by Russian rockets and airstrikes, where the mayor estimated 200 dead lay beneath the rubble. In the besieged port of Mariupol, local officials have put the death toll in the thousands.\nFierce fighting continues along Ukraine’s southern coast, where Mariupol, largely reduced to ruins by Russian bombardment, is “the center of hell,” said Martin Griffiths, the U.N. chief of humanitarian relief.\nMore than 250 miles west of Mariupol, explosions shuddered through the port of Mykolaiv, a day after the mayor said Russian strikes had killed 10 people and wounded 46. He said that Russians had hit residential buildings, schools, a hospital and an orphanage in his city since the war began, and had used cluster munitions. Soldiers defending the city said that increasingly, Russian forces were hitting civilian targets.\nAfter four consecutive days of trying and failing to send an aid convoy into Mariupol, where people are desperately short of food, water, power, heat and medicines, the International Committee of the Red Cross decided against another attempt on Tuesday.\nUkrainian officials say the Russians have prevented crucial supplies from reaching the city. Mr. Nebenzya, the Russian U.N. ambassador, said the Ukrainians had blocked the convoy, and he claimed that Russian forces had evacuated 123,500 people from Mariupol.\nThe U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said that in fact, tens of thousands of Ukrainians, including from Mariupol, had been taken to “filtration camps” in Russia, where family members were separated and people were stripped of passports and cellphones. “I do not need to spell out what these so-called filtration camps are reminiscent of,” she said. “It’s chilling, and we cannot look away.”\nRosemary A. DiCarlo, a U.N. under secretary general, said there was credible evidence that Russia had used cluster munitions — shells that burst open to spew many smaller bomblets over a wide area — at least 24 times in populated areas of Ukraine. Most countries have signed a treaty banning cluster munitions as indiscriminate weapons with a high risk of civilian casualties, but Russia, like the United States, has not.\nMore than 11 million Ukrainians — about one in four — have fled their homes because of the war, including more than 4 million who have left the country, according to the United Nations, creating Europe’s largest and fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II.\nRussian forces recently captured the eastern city of Izyum, and Western analysts say they are preparing for a drive to the south and southeast, to bolster efforts to seize more of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting for eight years. Many of Ukraine’s best-equipped and most experienced military units have been concentrated in that area, known as Donbas.\n“Russian forces continue to make little to no progress in frontal assaults” on the portions of Donbas still held by Ukraine, the Institute for the Study of War reported.\nWhether the Russians aim simply to reinforce their units in Donbas, or are planning a more ambitious effort to encircle the Ukrainian forces, capturing Sloviansk is crucial, the institute said.\nIn the Luhansk region on Tuesday, an attack that Ukrainians blamed on Russian forces hit a storage tank containing nitric acid, releasing a toxic cloud and prompting the regional administrator to urge people to stay inside and close their windows.\nThe Russian units that withdrew from the region around Kyiv, having suffered heavy casualties, extensive equipment losses and poor morale, the institute said, “are highly unlikely to be effectively deployed elsewhere in Ukraine and are likely a spent force.”\nAn intelligence assessment released by the British defense ministry was less definitive, but said that any Russian forces redeploying from the north would first need considerable time to repair and replace equipment, and to make up for casualties.",

      "headline": "Zelensky vilifies Russia over atrocities: ‘They killed entire families.’",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/world/europe/zelensky-russia-atrocities-ukraine.html",
      "text": "Raging at Russia over growing evidence of atrocities, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Tuesday delivered one of his most forceful denunciations of the invasion in a live video speech to the United Nations Security Council, calling the Russians war criminals who he said had killed families, raped women in front of their children, pillaged homes and left his country in ruins, “filled with mass graves.”\nIn his speech — a day after touring Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv, the capital, where images have surfaced of many bodies of civilians Mr. Zelensky said had been killed by retreating Russian troops — the Ukrainian president said the Security Council was useless if it could not find a way to hold the perpetrators to account.\n“There is not a single crime that they would not commit there,” Mr. Zelensky said of the departed Russian troops.\n“Now the world can see what the Russian military did in Bucha, but the world has yet to see what it has done in other parts of our country,” Mr. Zelensky said.\n“Where is the security that the Security Council needs to guarantee?” he asked. “It’s not there.”\nMuch of his speech was laced with frustration with the United Nations for having failed to avert the war by not enforcing basic principles of the organization’s founding charter.\n“Show how we can reform and work for peace,” Mr. Zelensky implored council members. Otherwise, he said, “dissolve yourself altogether, if there is nothing you can do besides conversation.”\nMr. Zelensky also called for the creation of a tribunal that would prosecute the Russians he said were responsible for the atrocities, including leaders in Moscow, drawing an analogy to the Nuremberg court that tried Nazi war criminals.\nThe Kremlin has denied any responsibility for the civilian atrocities in Bucha or elsewhere in Ukraine and has said the photographs and visual evidence of execution-style killings in the northern suburbs are fabrications.\nAn analysis of satellite images by The New York Times rebuts claims by Russia that the killing of civilians in Bucha occurred after its soldiers had left the town.\n“They purposely killed anyone,” Mr. Zelensky said. “They killed entire families, adults and children, and they tried to burn the bodies.”\nSome victims in Bucha were “shot and killed in the back of their heads,” he said, while “some were shot on the street, others thrown into wells.”\nIt was Mr. Zelensky’s first speech to the Security Council since the invasion more than a month ago, and he showed no sign of wishing to negotiate with Russia. Rather, he described the United Nations as a powerless and outdated organization that needed to purge Russia of the veto power it wields on the council.\nAfterward, the council viewed a short video supplied by the Ukraine government that showed images of what appeared to be charred, rotting and slaughtered bodies from several Ukrainian cities.\nBarbara Woodward, the British ambassador who is the council’s president for April, described the images as harrowing. “Speaking in my national capacity, we are appalled by what we have seen and reiterate our solidarity with Ukraine,” she said, a sentiment echoed by several other ambassadors.\nRussia’s ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, categorically rejected all of Mr. Zelensky’s accusations and said Russian forces could not have possibly committed such acts.\nHe suggested the Ukrainian leader had been deceived by the United States and its European allies. He also suggested that neo-Nazis controlled the Ukrainian government, invoking a false narrative that Russia has used to justify the invasion of the former Soviet republic.\nNazis, Mr. Nebenzya said, “are running the show” in Ukraine. “How can it be any other way when the people running Ukraine are Nazi collaborators?”\nAddressing Mr. Zelensky, the Russian ambassador said: “You simply prefer not to notice Ukrainian Nazis, pretending they’re not there. Unfortunately, they are there.”\nMr. Zelensky, who is Jewish, lost many family members in the Holocaust.\nThe Security Council meeting, which was called by Western members to discuss the atrocities uncovered this weekend, did not appear to shift any positions on the 15-member body, the most powerful in the U.N. system.\nRussia, one of the five veto-wielding permanent members, has long made clear it would block any measure that ascribes blame or responsibility for the war to Russia. It has found a supportive ally in China, which has said Russian grievances are legitimate and that peaceful negotiations are the only solution.\nChina’s ambassador, Zhang Jun, said the images from Bucha were disturbing but that accusations should not be launched at any side until an independent investigation established the facts. “Humanitarian issues should not be politicized,” said Mr. Zhang. “International aid agencies should maintain neutrality and impartiality.”",

      "text": "New video has emerged that adds to mounting evidence of atrocities carried out while Russia’s military occupied the suburban town of Bucha, northwest of Kyiv.\nThe video shows a cyclist moving along a street in Bucha, dismounting and walking a bicycle around the corner onto a street occupied by Russian soldiers. As soon as the cyclist rounds the turn, a Russian armored vehicle fires several high-caliber rounds along the thoroughfare. A second armored vehicle fires two rounds in the direction of the cyclist. A plume of dust and smoke rises from the scene.\nThe video is aerial footage recorded by Ukraine’s military in early March when Russian forces still held the town. It has been independently verified by The New York Times.\nWeeks later, after Russia withdrew from Bucha, a body in civilian clothes was filmed beside a bicycle in this precise location in a second video verified by The Times. The body, with one leg mangled, lies behind a concrete utility pillar that has collapsed from an apparent strike. The damage to the pillar is consistent with high-caliber ammunition. The person’s clothing — a dark blue top and lighter pants — matches the cyclist’s attire.\nIn the aerial footage, the Russian armored vehicles visible on the street appear to be BMD-4 infantry fighting vehicles, which are commonly mounted with a 100-millimeter gun and 30-millimeter cannon, according to a Times analysis of the video. More than 20 Russian military vehicles are positioned near the two vehicles that fired, both on the same street and stretching for blocks along a cross street.\nThe military convoy is stationed at an intersection on Yablonska Street, where The Times on Monday documented more than a dozen dead bodies. Satellite images confirmed that the people were killed in March while Russia controlled the town; the new video confirms that a Russian convoy was situated where many of those bodies were found.",

      "text": "Fewer than 800 coronavirus deaths are being reported each day in the United States, the lowest daily average since before the Omicron variant took hold late last fall. The last time the rate was this low was in mid-August, according to a New York Times database.\nTrends in deaths lag behind cases and hospitalizations by weeks because of the time it takes for people to become seriously ill, and the time needed to complete and file death records.\nThe seven-day average of new cases has also dropped significantly from the height of the Omicron surge. Though the decrease has slowed in recent days, the average has hovered this past week around 30,000 cases per day, a level last seen in July. Coronavirus hospitalizations plummeted in the last two weeks by about 36 percent, to about 18,000 per day. Intensive care unit hospitalizations have fallen too — by about 43 percent — to under 3,000.\nBut as cases increased in parts of Europe, scientists and health officials have already been warning of another rise in U.S. cases and, with it, the first major test of the country’s strategy of living with the virus while limiting its impact. Top U.S. health officials reiterated concerns last week about the impact of stalled Covid-19 response aid amid the spread of BA.2, a highly transmissible Omicron subvariant accounting for about 35 percent of new U.S. cases, as of Monday, and a form of the virus similar to what swept through the nation this winter.\nA growing number of U.S. states are reporting fewer daily updates, saying that metrics like hospitalizations and wastewater monitoring have become more relevant than daily case reports. Still, Kentucky, New York, Colorado and Texas are among a few states that are showing a rise in new cases over the past two weeks.\n“I think it’s very hard for anyone to give a definitive answer for what’s happening here,” said Gigi Gronvall, a testing expert and a senior scholar at the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University, referring to the surge in parts of Europe and what that could portend for the United States. “We don’t know everything there is to know.”\nEvery state and many municipalities have relaxed many Covid precautions, and officials are mostly encouraging Americans to return to prepandemic routines. On Saturday, Hawaii became the final state in the nation to remove its indoor masking requirement.\nIn late February, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created an online tool that shows Americans whether their area is at high, medium or low community risk for the coronavirus. On Monday, only 53 of the roughly 3,000 U.S. counties were categorized as high risk.\nThe World Health Organization reported last week that the BA.2 subvariant that is helping to drive another surge of coronavirus cases in Europe is now the dominant version of Omicron around the world.\nAnd several countries in East Asia are getting rid of Covid rules quickly, even as the Omicron variant continues spreading in parts of the region. China, though, is still enforcing stricter measures.\nThe United States, with ample vaccine supply, has suffered the highest known total deaths — more than 975,000 — and the coronavirus is killing Americans at far higher rates than people in other wealthy nations, a New York Times analysis showed last month.\nSome experts warn of another potential U.S. wave, spurred by BA.2.\n“How pronounced that wave is, and what toll it takes on our populations, has a lot to do with how well we pay attention to leading edge indicators, and actually implement a collective, public response to mitigating spread,” said Jason L. Salemi, an epidemiologist at the University of South Florida who tracks Covid data.",

      "headline": "A Vow to Ease Bombing Is Too Late for Many in Ukraine City Near Kyiv",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/europe/chernihiv-kyiv-ukraine-russia.html",
      "text": "KYIV, Ukraine — Thousands of people have been fleeing the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, escaping towns and villages under attack by Russian troops across the region. Many of them are from the city of Chernihiv, with bleak faces and crushing stories.\nThey have been arriving in steady droves in recent days at Kyiv’s central station, clutching bags and children, their eyes hollow and full of strain.\n“The city is under fire all the time,” said Iryna Shepetova, 35, hugging one of her children after sleeping the night on a bench in the station. “The mayor told us you are responsible for your own lives.”\nShe escaped with her three children and her mother on one of the last minibuses out of the city last week, as Russian forces closed in.\nChernihiv guards the left bank of the Desna River and has been a target for Russian forces advancing on Kyiv since the start of the war five weeks ago. Thwarted from seizing control of Chernihiv, Russian units surrounded it and pounded it with airstrikes and artillery fire, as a second battalion group moved in to encircle it from the south.\nOn Tuesday, in negotiations in Istanbul aimed at ending the war, the Russians said they would ease their bombardment of Chernihiv, but their positions around it are already so fortified, and the city itself so battered, that the offer hardly amounted to a concession at all.\n“They were purposely bombing schools,” said Vera Kaydash, 67, a retired physician. “There were lines for bread and water and they fired on the people waiting.” She said she knew two people who were among those killed in an attack on a line outside a grocery store.\nWater and electricity were out, only gas was working on one side of town, and telephone and internet services were down, she said. In her former hospital, the damage had made the X-ray and dialysis departments unusable, she said. “They destroyed them in such a way that only after the war would we be able to replace them.”\n“I have not seen such cynical behavior in my life,” she said.\nSo when the city’s mayor, Vladyslav Atroshenko, urged those who could to get out and volunteers from a private bus company organized minibuses, dozens of people decided to risk it. Cars trying to escape had come under repeated fire and there was no guarantee of safe passage for civilians, but the situation inside the city was becoming increasingly precarious.\n“A great number of cars came under fire and many people died,” said Dr. Kaydash’s husband, Mikhail, 68, who accompanied his wife and sister. He said he was surprised that they got through. “We were lucky, it was quiet.”\nThey made a tortuous six-hour journey along back roads through woods and fields to avoid Russian positions, listening to the pounding of tank and mortar fire not far away.\nMs. Shepetova left behind her husband since, she said, men between the ages of 18 and 60 were not allowed to board the buses. Dr. Kaydash left behind her daughter and family.\nThen three days after their escape, Russian planes bombed the only bridge leading out of Chernihiv, cutting the exit route for tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers still inside. There remains a pedestrian bridge across the river but it is damaged and exposed to Russian shelling and gunfire, the mayor said.\nHe asked for help for his besieged city last weekend in a video call with journalists. “We are looking for way to bring 44 seriously wounded people out,” he said. “They need urgent evacuation.” The wounded were mostly military, he said, but included civilians and three children.\nMore than 200 people had been killed in attacks on Chernihiv, he said, adding that destruction was so extensive, “it is now easier to count those buildings that have not been damaged.”\nSince then, families have still been trickling out on increasingly dangerous journeys, making their way from the city on foot and ferried across the river by volunteers in small boats. Many are so terrified of the prospect of a Russian takeover that they did not want their full names published, but recounted their experiences.\nOne family said they walked and drove for three days through villages before finding a way across the river. “We were a group of seven with one child and a grandmother who is disabled,” said Svetlana, 40. “We had to make a huge hook around, for 50 kilometers, with him,” she said pointing to her five-year-old son, Dyma. They loaded their bags onto two bicycles and pushed them along, she said.\nPeople described a chaotic and dangerous situation with front lines shifting as Russian forces sought to encircle the city and Ukrainian forces mounted a counterattack.\n“All the ways out of Chernihiv are being shot at by the Russians,” said Alyona Sukhova, who drove out with her husband and 14-year-old daughter, Olha, from a rural area south of the river on Monday. “It was risky,” said her husband, Pavlo Sukhov, who did the driving. “The Russians had been pushed back a bit so there was a small window to get out.”\nAs fighting swirled around the city, ordinary civilians going about their work were caught up in incomprehensible shootings.\nTwo women from Chernihiv were working as cooks in a factory in the nearby town of Sevchenkove when it was stormed by Russian troops. “The first day a woman and a man were shot in their car,” said one of the women, Alla, 44. “It was scary to go out at all.” They sheltered in the basement of their hostel and then a Russian tank fired point blank at the building.\n“They shot with tanks on our building,” said the other, Yulia, 55. “Thank God nothing fell on us.” The two women caught a ride in someone’s car and fled, but they were now homeless since they could not return to Chernihiv. Alla said her 17-year-old son was stuck there.\nOn a road south of Chernihiv a mechanic, Vitaliy, 42, was fetching supplies of flour from a farm several weeks ago when he ran into a column of Russian tanks and armored personnel carriers advancing from the opposite direction.\n“It’s one in a million that I am alive,” he said, nursing a shattered arm and bandaged eye at a hospital on Kyiv’s left bank. “I got two bullets in my head,” he added, pulling up the hospital X-rays on his phone.\nWhen he saw the column he stopped his car, Vitaly said, and pulled off the road, but the Russian troops opened fire on his car so he ran into the field and lay down.\n“There was no cover and then they started shooting at me,” he said. Bullets were flying around him and until one shattered his arm and another pierced his eye, lodging in his brain. He remained conscious as the convoy passed and Ukrainian members of the territorial defense rescued him. “I thought the column would just go by,” he said simply.\nDropped off at the central train station in Kyiv, the evacuees from Chernihiv sat exhausted on benches in the vaulted passenger halls, waiting for trains to safer destinations in central or western Ukraine. They expressed relief but also some resentment at those ignorant of the scale of the war in their city.\n“Kyiv is relatively safe,” Ms. Shepetova said, looking around. “But there are a lot of military forces and I would like to see them where they are needed.”\nMr. Kaydash called for more international help, especially in stopping the Russian air attacks.\n“If Chernihiv falls, the Russians will come to Kyiv,” he said. “The Ukrainians are fighting furiously. It would be nice to have some support.”\nMr. Kaydash listed the countries where Russia has seized territory over the last 30 years. “It began from Moldova and Georgia and continued in Ukraine,” he said. “And there is Poland next door. Ukraine might be not the end. It might continue.”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/middleeast/israel-shooting-deaths.html",
      "text": "JERUSALEM — A Palestinian gunman killed five people in an ultra-Orthodox city outside of Tel Aviv on Tuesday night, the latest in a surge of attacks in Israel this month.\nThe shooting was the fifth attack in less than two weeks, and brought the total death toll in recent days to 11 — the most people killed by militants in such a short period in Israel, outside of a full-scale war, in several years.\nThe spasm of violence heightened fears of an even more intense surge over the next month, when the rare convergence of Ramadan, Passover and Easter is expected to raise tensions further between Israelis and Palestinians.\nMagen David Adom, an Israeli emergency medical service, said that four victims were pronounced dead at the scene of the attack in Bnei Brak, a religious suburb on the eastern edge of Tel Aviv. A fifth was taken to the hospital where he died, according to a medic who was with him in the ambulance.\nOne of the victims was a police officer from a squad that intercepted and killed the attacker, the police said. The officer was later named as Amir Khoury, a 32-year-old Arab Israeli from northern Israel. A second victim was identified by Israeli broadcasters as Yaakov Shalom, and two others were said to be foreign workers.\nTo the medics on the scene, the attack drew echoes of the second intifada, a Palestinian uprising that set off wave of violence from 2000 to 2005 that killed more than 1,000 Israelis and 3,000 Palestinians.\n“This definitely brings back old memories,” Daniel Amzallag, the medic who accompanied the fifth victim to the hospital, said in a phone interview. “It’s been a very long time since an event that major.”\nAfter the attack, the Israeli Police said that all its forces would begin focusing on counterterrorism and street presence, scaling back other activities, and extending the length of its shifts. The Israeli Army said it was sending extra troops to the occupied West Bank, where the shooter was said to have lived.\nThe Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, met with senior security officials in the aftermath of the attack and condemned the violence.\n“Israel is facing a wave of murderous Arab terrorism,” he said in a statement.\n“The security forces are at work,” he added. “We will fight terror with persistence, diligence and an iron fist. They will not move us from here. We will prevail.”\nVideo broadcast by Kan, the Israeli public broadcaster, showed the gunman walking across a quiet street and firing an assault rifle at passers-by and a cyclist, who managed to cycle away.\nHe then shouted to a passing driver in Hebrew to “stop,” before opening fire into the car, causing it to crash. Another video showed the gunman approaching a person sitting in a chair outside a shop, and shooting the person dead from behind.\nThe shooter then drove the motorcycle or scooter to a second nearby location, where he was shot and killed by the police shortly after 8 p.m., a police spokesman said.\nOne volunteer medic with Magen David Adom, Menachem Englander, who lives yards from the attack, said he narrowly avoided being shot himself after leaving his home upon hearing the first gunshots.\n“I immediately went out to the street and saw a terrorist pointing a weapon at me,” Mr. Englander said in a statement published by Magen David Adom. “By a miracle his weapon jammed and he couldn’t shoot.”\nThe gunman was a Palestinian from the northern West Bank who was jailed for six months several years ago for arms trafficking and membership in a terrorist group, Kan reported. A Palestinian news agency, Shehab News, posted video of young Palestinian men celebrating on Tuesday night in what the agency said was the attacker’s village.\nMahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, which manages parts of the West Bank, broke his usual habit of staying silent after terrorist attacks in Israel to condemn the shootings. \n“The killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians will only lead to further deterioration of the situation, especially as we are approaching the holy month of Ramadan and the Christian and Jewish holidays,” he said in a statement published by Wafa, a news agency run by the authority.\nHamas, the Islamist group that is the de facto authority in the Gaza Strip, praised the attack in a statement as a “heroic operation” but did not directly claim responsibility for it.\nA Hamas official said it was a response to the groundbreaking summit held Monday in the Negev Desert in southern Israel, in which four Arab foreign ministers gathered for the first time on Israeli soil for a diplomatic meeting, disappointing many Palestinians who saw the move as a betrayal.\nThe attack was “a quick response to the summit of shame and disgrace held in the Negev,” Mosheer al-Masri, the official, said during an interview with a Hamas-run television channel.\nViolence often rises during Ramadan, which starts later this week — and Ramadan-related tensions were one catalyst for an 11-day war between Israel and Islamist militants in Gaza last May.\nAnalysts fear that further violence could break out in Jerusalem, where higher numbers of Jews and Muslims are likely to try to enter the Temple Mount or the Aqsa Mosque compound during the overlapping festivals.\nThe attack on Tuesday came two days after another gun attack in Hadera, northern Israel, where two Arab Israelis armed with heavy automatic weapons fatally shot two police officers. Unusually, the attack was later claimed by Islamic State, rather than by a Palestinian militant group.\nThe brazen nature of both attacks alarmed security officials because they involved firearms, implying a level of planning usually absent from recent terrorist attacks in Israel, which have been mostly carried out with knives.\nIn a third attack last Monday in southern Israel, an assailant killed four people, stabbing three and ramming another with his car.\nMost of the recent victims have been Israeli Jews, but some were also members of Israel’s Arab minority.\nMansour Abbas, an Arab Israeli politician who leads the first independent Arab party to join an Israeli government, also condemned the attack, noting that terrorists do not distinguish between Arabs and Jews.\n“We all stand together in the face of a murderous wave of terror,” he said.",

      "headline": "Sanctioned Oligarch’s Presence Adds Intrigue to Ukraine-Russia Talks",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/europe/ukraine-russia-abramovich-oligarchs.html",
      "text": "LVIV, Ukraine — When diplomats from Russia and Ukraine met for talks in the 19th-century Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul on Tuesday, their host urged the antagonists to reach a cease-fire “to the benefit of everyone.”\nThose words from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey may have resonated in particular with a Russian oligarch in the room, mysteriously watching from a front-row seat.\nThe oligarch, Roman Abramovich, the 55-year-old owner of Britain’s storied Chelsea Football Club soccer team, is not a member of the Russian side of the talks. He has been sanctioned by the British government — but, curiously, not the United States — for ties with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who started the war.\nBritain’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said that oligarchs like Mr. Abramovich should “hang their heads in shame.” Ukraine’s ambassador to Britain, Vadym Prystaiko, told the BBC that he had “no idea what Mr. Abramovich is claiming or doing” at the talks. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, would not specify what Mr. Abramovich was doing but said Moscow had “approved” his participation to coordinate between both sides.\nThe unknowns of why he was in the room only added intrigue to the talks, which were reported to have made the first significant progress since the war began more than a month ago. And in a further hint of mystery, news emerged that Mr. Abramovich had been entangled in a bizarre episode, earlier this month, concerning whether he and members of the Ukrainian negotiating team were poisoned.\nThe oligarch, who did not comment on why he was attending the talks, appeared to be trying to present himself to the world as an earnest and trusted conduit between Kyiv and Moscow. Critics of Mr. Abramovich suggested he was grandstanding for publicity, part of an effort to save his empire.\nStill, Mr. Abramovich has gotten close to a key member of Ukraine’s negotiating team, Rustem Umerov, according to a person familiar with the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations are delicate. Mr. Umerov, this person said, believes that Mr. Abramovich wants to see the war stopped.\nBy the time Mr. Abramovich had been sanctioned by the British government, he had been playing a quiet role in the peace process. He was acknowledged as part of a public round of negotiations in Belarus that began four days into the war. But now reports have emerged of Mr. Abramovich’s participation in a less publicized track, mediated by Turkey, which had him shuttling between Kyiv, Moscow and Istanbul.\nHis role included personally delivering a handwritten letter by President Volodomyr Zelensky of Ukraine addressing an outline of his terms for an agreement to Mr. Putin, according to a report from The Sunday Times.\nOf all the rich businessmen around the Russian president, Mr. Abramovich, a Russian-Portuguese-Israeli multibillionaire, stands alone in his ability to combine both a reputation for high-level Kremlin connections and a celebrity profile — if not status and acceptance — in the capitals of the West.\nMr. Abramovich started working in business in the late 1980s, buying and selling dolls, chocolates, cigarettes, and more. He began to amass his fortune in the mid-1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when he and a business partner persuaded the Russian government to sell them the state-run oil company Sibneft for about $200 million. In 2005, while he was serving as the governor of Russia’s resource-rich northeastern province of Chukotka, he sold his stake back to the government for $11.9 billion.\nAs Mr. Putin brought businessmen to heel by jailing and intimidating them, Mr. Abramovich was among the billionaires who managed to remain on good terms with the Kremlin. He used his wealth to buy luxury properties in New York, London, Tel Aviv, St. Barts and Aspen, Colorado, as well as two superyachts, multiple Ferrari, Porsche and Aston Martin sports cars, and a private Boeing 787 Dreamliner jet — now grounded because of the sanctions on him.\nHe has also extensively funded the Moscow art scene, including as co-founder of the Garage Center for Contemporary Art in Moscow, and played a role on the board of the famed Bolshoi Theater.\nLast year, his net worth was estimated by Forbes at $14.5 billion, making him one of Israel’s richest citizens and the 11th richest Russian. Much of it may have evaporated because of the onerous sanctions. Britain has imposed such tight restrictions on Mr. Abramovich’s Chelsea club that some say they amount to government control.\nOn the eve of the Ukraine-Russia discussions in Istanbul, reports emerged in The Wall Street Journal and in Bellingcat, an investigative journalism group, that Mr. Abramovich, Mr. Umerov and another Russian businessman had suffered symptoms associated with poisoning between the night of March 3 and the morning of March 4 after a round of consultations.\nAccording to Bellingcat, the participants all drank only water and ate chocolate. Negotiations went until 10 p.m. that night in Kyiv, and overnight the men began experiencing the symptoms, including impaired vision and peeling skin.\nAs they drove from Kyiv to the western Ukrainian city of Lviv — en route, via Poland, to the next round of negotiations in Turkey — the team enlisted the help of Bellingcat’s executive director, Christo Grozev, who had extensively researched the poisoning of the Russian opposition politician, Aleksei A. Navalny.\nThe symptoms were severe enough that Mr. Abramovich asked the scientist examining him, “Are we dying?” one person who was present told The New York Times.\nThe experts who examined the men said “the dosage and type of toxin used was likely insufficient to cause life-threatening damage, and most likely was intended to scare the victims as opposed to cause permanent damage,” according to a series of Twitter postings from Bellingcat. “The victims said they were not aware of who might have had an interest in an attack,” they said.\nSome Western officials sought to tamp down concerns over possible poisoning, suggesting that “environmental factors” were responsible.\n“The evidence is rather sketchy and in a difficult place,” one Western official said.\nMr. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said Tuesday that the reports of poisoning were part of an “information war.”\nBesides the British sanctions on him, Mr. Abramovich also has come under European Union and Canadian sanctions. Reports have emerged of Mr. Zelensky asking President Biden to refrain from sanctioning Mr. Abramovich because of the role he has been playing.\n“This is a combined operation — to help him and to help the Kremlin,” said Ksenia Svetlova, a Moscow-born Israeli political analyst, former lawmaker, and expert on the Russian Israeli community.\n“Moscow thinks they can use him,” she said, “and the West also thinks they can use him.”\nThe fact that he is not part of Russia’s official delegation, she said, gave him more leeway to reach a compromise.\n“It’s the story of good cop, bad cop — there is the official delegation, and Abramovich has a little more freedom. He’s another arm of the Kremlin — not an official arm, but a softer one.”\nFor Chelsea supporters, details of Mr. Abramovich’s role as an apparent intermediary has only led to further confusion about how the billionaire oligarch should be regarded. “The fact he’s trying to broker peace does put a slightly different slant on things than how they appeared to be two or three weeks ago,” said Tim Rolls, a member of the Chelsea Supporters Trust. “I think some think he’s been hard done by but it’s impossible to know what the situation is.”\nWhat is not in doubt is the admiration for Mr. Abramovich that many Chelsea fans still have for the man who invested heavily in their team and took it to new heights.\n“I think it’s impossible for a layman like me to know exactly how close he is to Vladimir Putin,” Mr. Rolls said. “For me and supporters it’s been tremendous. He’s taken us to the next level, to becoming one of the top six or top eight teams in Europe.”",

      "headline": "Shanghai’s Lockdown Tests Covid-Zero Policy, and People’s Limits",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/asia/china-shanghai-covid-lockdown.html",
      "text": "Even before Shanghai imposed a lockdown to curb a rapidly spreading Covid outbreak, life for many in China’s wealthiest city had been upended by the virus — and the government’s response.\nResidents raced to hoard groceries in case they were ordered to stay home. Some protested at the gates of housing complexes that were locked with little notice. Others, sent to government isolation facilities, were forced to sleep on the floor because of a shortage of beds.\nFor still others, the city’s Covid-19 restrictions have had life-threatening implications. Some residents have been confined at home, unable to get kidney dialysis or other urgent treatment. A nurse who suffered an asthma attack died after she was denied care by a hospital that cited Covid prevention protocols.\nOfficials had tried to limit disruptions by confining buildings or neighborhoods, arguing that a full-scale lockdown in the city of 26 million was untenable. Officials said their more surgical approach would curb the outbreak while preserving economic life in Shanghai, a hub for international business.\nThen, on Sunday evening, the city’s officials signaled that doing both at once might no longer be feasible. The city declared a staggered lockdown that closed nonessential businesses, halted public transportation and confined the majority of the population to their homes.\nThe measures split the city in half, first closing the eastern section for a five-day quarantine starting Monday, before turning to a similar shutdown in the western portion. Shanghai’s caseload of 3,500 on Monday was tiny compared with much of the world, but it has been driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Officials said the lockdown would enable the authorities to conduct mass testing.\nChina has been grappling with the country’s largest outbreak since the pandemic began in Wuhan more than two years ago. The government’s fear is that an uncontrolled spread could overwhelm hospitals and cause a catastrophic loss of life. Large numbers of Chinese adults 80 and older are unvaccinated, and there is little immunity from earlier infections. Hong Kong’s struggle to contain a Covid outbreak has offered a glimpse of what that might look like: Deaths there spiked in recent weeks, particularly among unvaccinated older adults.\n“The challenge is that lockdowns and nucleic testing demand manpower and medical resources in addition to their impact on the economy and life in general,” said Dali Yang, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago.\n“The leadership is trying hard to continue the current practices but are also assessing. But Omicron may very well force the hand of the leadership” to abandon its unsustainable reliance on lockdowns, he said. The government has been working on administering vaccine boosters for the elderly and buying anti-viral drugs to prepare for such a scenario, he said.\nThe central government is still pushing officials across the country to stamp out the virus, deploying measures that are among the world’s strictest, including isolating anyone who tests positive and enforcing quarantines on people deemed at risk of infection. White-collar employees, shoppers and diners have been forced to isolate inside offices, stores and restaurants if they were deemed to be close contacts. People who test positive are sent either to hospitals or to government isolation facilities set up in schools, exhibition centers and other spaces.\nIn Shanghai, though, signs abound that the policy, and the populace, are stretched thin.\nIvy Sun, a 32-year-old counselor, had been looking forward to freedom after being held in her home under a five-day lockdown on her neighborhood. On Sunday, after the announcement of the citywide closure, she was suddenly allowed a breath of fresh air, but just for seven hours. She and her neighbors rushed out to get groceries and other supplies for yet another confinement.\n“It felt like an apocalyptic scene. Everyone ran out. A lot of people were on the streets near the neighborhood, and all the stores were filled with people,” Ms. Sun said.\nMs. Sun said that during her first lockdown, she couldn’t get groceries online because they sold out quickly. She and her neighbors got together and began buying necessities in bulk. She also wondered whether the panic-buying on Sunday, in which people crammed together inside enclosed stores, could have worsened the spread of the virus.\nIn other cases, the unpredictability of the restrictions and seemingly indefinite confinement triggered protests. In central Shanghai, around two dozen residents of Jinghua Xinyuan, an apartment complex, crowded in front of a marble and metal security gate that was locked to prevent them from leaving.\n“We want to get out,” several residents shouted at police officers posted outside on Sunday afternoon, according to a video posted to Weibo that day and verified by The New York Times.\nThe authorities had locked residents in the compound for three days, yet did not administer Covid tests even though some people had the virus, according to residents’ accounts posted online. They had given conflicting messages about how long this would go on, the residents complained.\n“The day before yesterday, they told us the 14-day lockdown had started. Yesterday, they said that the 14 days started yesterday, and today they said it started today,” shouted one man who wore a black cap and a sweatshirt. “Am I on a cruise at sea or what?”\nCalls to the neighborhood committee and the management office of the complex rang unanswered on Tuesday. A duty officer who answered the phone at the Xuhui district police station denied that there had been a protest.\nWhile the authorities have been quick to enforce isolation and home quarantine on residents, they have lagged in ensuring that all those in confinement can get help for serious medical conditions. Many residents have resorted to going online to beg for access to treatment such as dialysis.\nLuker Dong, a resident in Pudong, said that his 73-year-old father suffered from uremia — a buildup of toxins in the blood — that required him to get hemodialysis at a hospital three times a week. But he has been forced to go without treatment for four days since his building went under lockdown, Mr. Dong said.\nHospitals also would not accept his father, citing concerns about the outbreak, and the health authorities have not helped, he said. His father’s feet had swollen without the dialysis, which helps to filter waste and water from his blood.\n“If his organs fail, it will be too late,” Mr. Dong said in a telephone interview. Mr. Dong has posted calls for help on his Weibo page, saying on Monday: “I cannot just watch my father wait for his death at home.”\nShanghai’s top health authorities have said that hospitals should ensure people who require treatments like dialysis and chemotherapy can get help while in lockdown. But cases like that of Mr. Dong’s father exposed gaps in the system.\nSuch scenes and complaints were common in Wuhan and the province of Hubei when the outbreak first emerged because the health care system there was quickly overwhelmed. In Shanghai, where hospitals are among the country’s best, accounts of residents being denied treatment because of Covid measures have similarly stirred widespread anger and grief.\nLast week, a nurse suffered an asthma attack but couldn’t get help from the emergency department at the hospital where she worked because it was closed for Covid disinfection. Her family rushed her to another hospital but she died, according to a statement from Shanghai East Hospital, her employer.\nOn Friday, officials from Shanghai’s health commission expressed condolences to the nurse’s family. They urged hospitals to speed up infection screening, contact tracing and disinfection protocols to minimize disruptions to normal medical services.\nStill, Feng Wenliang, a reporter at the state-run China Food Security Newspaper, described the nurse’s death as shameful. “This slap was extremely loud,” he wrote on his social media account.\n“It has been three years since the pandemic, for such a thing to happen in Shanghai, which is at the forefront of national prevention and control,” he added. “Their own nurse was sick, and the hospital where she worked refused to accept her.”\n“She was a nurse, but even more a patient.”",

      "headline": "Reports of sexual violence involving Russian soldiers are multiplying, Ukrainian officials say.",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/europe/russian-soldiers-sexual-violence-ukraine.html",
      "text": "The crime first came to light last week, when Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said in a Facebook post that a Russian soldier had killed an unarmed civilian and then repeatedly raped his wife. Days later, the White House said it was concerned about emerging reports of sexual violence in Ukraine.\nThen on Monday night, The Times of London published the woman’s chilling account. Using the pseudonym Natalya, she told a reporter she had been in her home in a village near the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, when she heard footsteps and a shot rang out. Moments later her husband lay dead outside her front door, and two Russian soldiers were at her side, one holding a gun to her head.\n“I shot your husband because he was a Nazi,” the gunman told her, before he and the other soldier raped her, as her 4-year-old son sobbed in a boiler room next door, according to The Times. She said she was later raped a second time by the soldiers, and eventually managed to flee to western Ukraine with her son.\n“I could have been silent, but when we got to the police, my husband’s sister made me speak up, and there was no going back,” she was quoted saying in The Times. “I understand that many people who have been hurt would stay silent because they are afraid. Lots of people don’t believe terrible things like this happen.”\nA Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, rejected Ms. Venediktova’s allegation, telling reporters in Moscow last week that “we don’t believe it at all.”\n“It is a lie,” Mr. Peskov said, according to the Interfax news agency.\nMs. Venediktova said a Russian soldier is wanted for arrest “on suspicion of violation of the laws and customs of war.”\nUkrainian officials contend that numerous cases of rape and sexual violence have occurred in the country since Russia’s invasion began on Feb. 24.\nMaria Mezentseva, a Ukrainian member of parliament, detailed the woman’s account to Sky News on Sunday and said there were “many more victims.” She did not provide further details or say how she learned of other assaults, but said that she expected them to come to light once the victims were “ready to talk.”\n“We will definitely not be silent,” she said.\nRape and other forms of sexual violence, which have accompanied armed conflicts throughout history, can constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. Russian forces and Moscow-backed armed groups have been accused of perpetrating sexual violence in other conflicts — most recently involving detainees in eastern Ukraine.\nThis month, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said that he had little confidence that international organizations, like the International Criminal Court in The Hague, would hold Russian soldiers to account. “When Russian soldiers rape women in Ukrainian cities — it’s difficult of course to speak about the efficiency of international law,” he said via videolink during an event at Chatham House, a think tank in London.\nAccounts of rape and sexual violence began to emerge almost immediately after Russia invaded Ukraine, according to Kateryna Busol, an associate with Chatham House and a Ukrainian lawyer who documented allegations of sexual violence following Russia’s seizure and annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n“These accounts are growing, and we are hearing that they are much more widespread than the one account raised by the inspector general,” Ms. Busol said in a phone interview from Regensburg, Germany, where she fled from Kyiv in the days following the invasion.\n“What we are hearing by word of mouth, from acquaintances of survivors in the country, is horrific,” she added. “I have had described to me incidents of gang rape, rape in front of children and sexual violence following the killing of family members.”\nMost of the accounts, she said, involved female victims and were coming from cities in Ukraine’s east and the south occupied by Russian forces.",

      "text": "IRPIN, Ukraine — Creeping forward block by block, Ukrainian soldiers in a reconnaissance unit on Tuesday found signs of a retreating Russian army everywhere: a charred armored vehicle, abandoned body armor decorated with an orange and black St. George ribbon, a Russian military symbol, and the traditional blue-and-white striped underwear issued to Russian soldiers, cast aside in a forest.\nWhat they did not encounter was the Russian army in any organized state. After a month of savage street fighting, one of the most pivotal battles in the war so far ended this week — at least for now — with an improbable victory in Irpin for Ukraine’s outgunned and outnumbered military. By Tuesday, Ukrainian forces had quashed any significant Russian resistance in this strategic outlying town near Kyiv, the capital.\nPockets of Russian soldiers remained, posing risks. A firefight erupted in the afternoon when Ukrainian soldiers destroyed a lone Russian armored personnel carrier in an otherwise empty neighborhood, according to a commander.\nBut Ukraine’s military had essentially recaptured Irpin, a town both strategically and symbolically important as the closest the Russian army had gotten to Kyiv, just three miles away. Its success in driving the Russians away may have factored into the peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on Tuesday, when the two sides achieved what appeared to be their most substantive progress to date.\nMoscow promised to reduce “by multiples” the intensity of its military activity around Kyiv, an area that includes Irpin, in effect acknowledging that its advance toward the capital had stalled and was at least in some places being pushed back.\nWith superior numbers and weaponry, Russia could always decide to mount another assault on Irpin. And Ukrainian security experts expressed skepticism about Russia’s pledge to pull back. “They will not abandon plans to take the capital,” Oleksandr Danylyuk, a former secretary of Ukraine’s Security and Defense Council, said in an interview.\nStill, some people saw the recapture of Irpin as a moral victory, even if street fighting continued in the town and the military gains might be tentative.\nKyiv was always the biggest prize of all for the Russian military, as the seat of government and a city ingrained in both Russian and Ukrainian identity. But the Ukrainian military’s performance in the vicious street fighting in an arc of outlying towns and villages became emblematic of the challenges Russian forces would face as they attempted to encircle or capture the capital.\n“Today we have good news,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a videotaped address on Monday. “Our defenders are advancing in the Kyiv region, regaining control over Ukrainian territory.”\nMr. Zelensky said that the town of Irpin was now “liberated.” He added, “Well done. I am grateful to everyone who worked for this result.” He said some fighting continued.\nIn its attempt to capture the capital, the Russian military was bedeviled by logistical setbacks as it advanced in lumbering tank columns into the urban environment of Kyiv’s suburbs, where armored vehicles are vulnerable to ambushes. Over a month of fighting, with Ukraine’s military putting up fierce resistance, the losses piled up.\nWestern and Ukrainian officials have been saying for weeks that the Russians have taken heavy casualties in these suburban battles. That was on display on Tuesday, as the Ukrainian reconnaissance unit pushed into a scene of destruction in a neighborhood of one-story homes in Irpin.\nThe vicious give-and-take of the fighting for nearly a month left a sprawl of burned or blown-up buildings, tank tracks in the roads and bullet cartridges scattered all about. Wires sagged from the utility poles.\nThe area had been a base for Russian special operations soldiers, or Spetsnaz, and ethnic Chechens fighting on Russia’s side, according to Western military analysts and Ukrainian soldiers.\nHere, as elsewhere in the fighting around Kyiv, the Ukrainian military achieved its battlefield success by deploying small, fast-moving units largely on foot that staged ambushes or defended sites with the benefit of local knowledge. Many such units are based in central Kyiv, commuting to the war zone by car.\nThe reconnaissance unit that patrolled Irpin on Tuesday, a part of Ukraine’s military intelligence agency, uses as its base a shuttered bar in Kyiv, now cluttered with sleeping bags, boxes of ammunition and hand grenades.\nAt dawn on a clear, cold morning on Tuesday, the soldiers strapped on body armor and pouches of ammunition, with a crackling noise of Velcro, then jumped in place to ensure their gear was well attached. The bar’s stereo played Ukrainian folk songs.\nThe front in Irpin was a quick drive away. The soldiers filtered into the town in small groups of three or four, to avoid drawing Russian artillery, then regrouped in a maze of back streets.\n“We are defending our land,” said a commander of one of the two squads, consisting of eight men each. He asked to be identified only by his first name, Bohdan. While the Russian military has pulled back in force, he said, Ukrainian soldiers still must search house to house in the city to flush out pockets of remaining enemy soldiers.\n“We move into a neighborhood and if there is contact, we fire or call in artillery,” he said of these operations. “If there is no contact, well, then it is clear this territory is again ours.”\nThe mayor of Irpin, a once quiet and leafy suburb with a prewar population of about 70,000, said that all but about 4,000 civilians had fled. The patrol encountered only one elderly man, who waved from behind a window of a house.\nTwo hours into their rounds, the Ukrainians were panting and sweating, dashing between walls and into backyards, climbing in and out of broken windows. “They lived in these houses and they were firing on Kyiv from this neighborhood,” Bohdan said of the Russians.\nThe buzz of their drone was nearly always overhead, scouting the street in front of them.\nThrough most of the day, there were no sounds of small-arms fire anywhere in town. Such fire would indicate close engagements between the two armies. The soldiers passed a Russian military identification document, fluttering in the wind on the lawn of a house, but did not touch it to check the name, fearing a booby trap.\nIrpin has loomed large symbolically in the war not just because of its adjacency to the capital. In normal times, it was a town that conveyed nothing so much as the ordinariness and tranquillity of a middle-class suburban life in Kyiv, with parks for bike riding and tree-lined streets. But the fighting grew fiercer as Russia moved to encircle the capital, and the death of a mother and her two children fleeing the city early in the conflict — struck by a mortar as they crossed a bridge — came to represent the shattered sense of security in once-safe communities.\nIn a town park, the Ukrainian patrol found a destroyed Russian armored personnel carrier, burned in places to a rich orange color. Beside the vehicle were the traditional blue-and-white undershirts used by Russian soldiers, called telnyashkas. Elsewhere, they found a cardboard box labeled Russian army food. “Individual Food Ration,” the label said. “Not for Sale.”\nThe soldiers took selfies beside the incinerated armored personnel carrier. Some sank to the pine duff to rest, gazing at the spectacle of the destroyed vehicle where Russian soldiers had died. The bodies had been retrieved earlier, though by whom was unclear.\n“I don’t see the Russians as enemies,” said a Ukrainian soldier who offered only his first name, Hennady, out of concern for his safety. “They are just inert people, doing things without knowing what they are doing.”\nThe day had been quiet but suddenly shifted with a cacophony of heavy machine gun fire and explosions from rocket-propelled grenades as the squad led by Bohdan, which had remained behind, encountered a Russian armored personnel carrier. Why it remained in this place, otherwise empty of Russian soldiers, was unclear. Later, a commander said the vehicle was destroyed.\nSerhiy, one of the soldiers, offered a more skeptical assessment of Ukrainian gains in Irpin. While perhaps the largest occupied town was now recaptured, he said, Ukraine’s control was uncertain. “We have a tentative frontline” now outside Irpin, he said, “but the key word is tentative.”\n“Their goal is Kyiv,” he added. “They will come back. They will need to cover this ground again.”",

      "text": "ISTANBUL — The first signs of significant progress in peace talks between Russia and Ukraine emerged on Tuesday, but there was no hint of an imminent end to the suffering, with Russia appearing determined to capture more territory in eastern Ukraine and officials predicting that weeks of further negotiation were needed.\nAfter three hours of talks in Istanbul, Ukrainian officials said their country was ready to declare itself permanently neutral — forsaking the prospect of joining NATO, a key Russian demand — and discuss Russian territorial claims in exchange for “security guarantees” from a group of other nations. An aide to Ukraine’s president called the Russian delegation “constructive,” while Russia said it would “drastically” scale back its military activity around Kyiv to “increase mutual trust.”\nRussia’s statement that it will de-escalate the fighting around Kyiv — even as it keeps pounding other parts of Ukraine — may be little more than putting a positive gloss on its military being stymied in its attempts to seize or encircle the capital. In recent days, Ukrainian counteroffensives around the city have forced back Russian forces in some of the fiercest street battles of the war, though they remain within striking distance of Kyiv.\nNow, Russian officials said, the goal will be to take more territory in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, where Russia has installed two separatist statelets that President Vladimir V. Putin recognized last month as independent, but that no other nation has formally acknowledged.\nWestern officials and security analysts cautioned against taking at face value Russia’s statements about its aims in Kyiv or elsewhere.\nPresident Biden said he would not draw any conclusions about Russia’s intentions “until I see what their actions are.” Speaking after a White House meeting with the prime minister of Singapore, Mr. Biden added, “We’ll see if they follow through with what they are suggesting.”\n“In the meantime,” Mr. Biden said, “we’re going to continue to keep strong the sanctions and will continue to provide the Ukrainian military with the capacity to defend themselves.”\nSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken, on a diplomatic trip to Morocco, told reporters, “There is what Russia says and there’s what Russia does,” adding, “and what Russia is doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine and its people.”\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has worked hard to present Mr. Putin with a negotiated way to end the war, accompanied by Ukrainian concessions that would not go so far as to make his country a Russian satellite.\nThe offer to declare a permanent neutral status, Ukrainian officials in Istanbul said, means it would neither join the NATO alliance nor host foreign troops — a scenario that Mr. Putin used as one of the justifications for his invasion.\nUkrainian officials envision an arrangement in which a diverse group of countries — potentially including the United States, Germany, Turkey and China — would commit, if Ukraine were attacked, to providing it with military assistance and to imposing a no-fly zone if necessary. It was not clear that any of those countries had signed on to such guarantees.\n“This is probably the best outcome that could’ve been hoped for today,” said Samuel Charap, who studies Russian foreign policy at the RAND Corporation. “The Ukrainians have at least come up with something concrete to address the core Russian demand for Ukraine’s neutrality.”\nUkraine also signaled readiness to consider concessions related to the parts of its territory already occupied by Russia. It proposed a 15-year negotiating process for Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula seized by Russia in 2014, and said it was ready to rule out trying to retake it by force. Questions surrounding the eastern Donbas region, Ukrainian officials said, could be discussed at a possible meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Zelensky.\nRussia, for its part, said it was prepared to accelerate planning for such a summit meeting — something that Mr. Zelensky had long sought and that Moscow had resisted, casting Ukraine’s government as a mere puppet of Washington. But now, the Kremlin appears to be increasingly prepared to deal with Mr. Zelensky — in part because Ukraine’s resistance on the battlefield is leaving it no other choice.\nVladimir Medinsky, the head of Russia’s delegation, said that he viewed Ukraine’s proposals as “a constructive step in the search for a compromise.”\n“If the treaty is worked out quickly and the required compromise is found, the possibility of making peace will be much closer,” Mr. Medinsky said.\nUkraine and Russia would need at least two more weeks for talks with Russia and potential guarantor countries, Oleksandr Chalyi, a member of the Ukrainian delegation, told reporters after Tuesday’s session. Turkey said it was prepared to host a meeting of the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers to flesh out Tuesday’s talks, followed by a possible meeting between the two presidents.\n“You have shouldered a historic responsibility,” President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who hosted Tuesday’s talks at a 19th-century Ottoman palace on the banks of the Bosporus, told the Russian and Ukrainian delegates. “All the world is expecting good news from you.”\nTurkey has emerged as a pivotal intermediary in the talks, one of the few countries to maintain close ties to both Russia and Ukraine after the invasion. Though it is a NATO member, Turkey has refused to put in place sanctions against Russia, even as it offers military support to Ukraine. To underscore the latter, a member of the Ukrainian delegation, Mykhailo Podolyak, posted on Twitter on Tuesday a selfie with Haluk Bayraktar, a close associate of Mr. Erdogan and the head of a Turkish company that makes armed drones used by Ukraine.\nBut despite the positive signals, myriad diplomatic pitfalls remained. For example, Ukraine said that the international security guarantees would not apply to the disputed Donbas, but it is not clear how that area would be defined; the separatists claim far more territory than they controlled before the war.\n“The Russian delegation is constructive,” Mr. Podolyak, who is an aide to Mr. Zelensky, said. “This doesn’t mean that the negotiations are easy. They are difficult.”\nThere was also no reprieve on the ground in Ukraine. On Tuesday morning, a Russian cruise missile strike destroyed part of the main regional government office building in the southern city of Mikolaiv, killing at least nine people and injuring at least 28, Ukrainian officials said. \nIt was one of many attacks since the Feb. 24 invasion that appeared aimed at disabling government operations; the regional administrator, Vitaly Kim, said his own office was destroyed, but he was not in the building at the time. The Russian advance along the Black Sea coast west of Crimea stalled outside Mikolaiv, in an area that has seen intense combat.\nAnother Russian missile struck an oil depot on Monday night in the Rivne region in northwestern Ukraine, the second to be destroyed there, according to the regional administrator.\n“The scale of the challenges has not diminished,” Mr. Zelensky said in a statement. “The Russian army still has significant potential to continue attacks against our state. They still have a lot of equipment and enough people completely deprived of rights whom they can send to the cauldron of war. Therefore, we stay alert and do not reduce our defense efforts.”\nThe U.S. and British governments confirmed Ukrainian gains in towns around Kyiv — notably Irpin, scene of some of the fiercest street fighting — but advised skepticism about claims that Russia’s stance had changed.\n“Has there been some movement by some Russian units away from Kyiv in the last day or so? Yeah, we think so, small numbers,” said John F. Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman. But, he added, “We believe that this is a repositioning, not a real withdrawal, and that we should be prepared to watch for a major offensive against other areas in Ukraine.”\nThe British Defense Ministry warned that “Russia still poses a significant threat to the city through their strike capability.”\nRussia has signaled that it was narrowing its war aims to focus on taking more territory in the Donbas. Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, on Tuesday offered a possible justification for winding down the war effort elsewhere in the country by declaring, in televised remarks in Moscow, that Russia’s initial mission was accomplished.\n“In general, the main goals of the first stage of the special operation have been completed,” Mr. Shoigu said. “The combat potential of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has been significantly reduced, which makes it possible to focus the main attention and main efforts on achieving the main goal — the liberation of Donbas.”\nRussian forces have taken control of a land bridge along Ukraine’s southeastern coast linking Crimea to the Donbas. The lone holdout in that strip is the center of the devastated port city of Mariupol, where, the Institute for the Study of War reported on Tuesday, the Russians are still gaining ground, slowly tightening the noose around the fighters and civilians who remain.\nThousand of civilians have been killed in Mariupol, according to local officials — a claim that cannot be independently verified — and much of the city has been flattened. It remains under “continuous heavy shelling” by Russian forces, the British Defense Ministry said on Tuesday.\nIn the nearby port of Berdyansk, captured by the Russians, an evacuation convoy took 34 buses full of civilians out of the city, headed into territory held by Ukraine. In anther occupied city in the region, Melitopol, the mayor said the schools chief had been detained after she and local teachers refused orders by the occupying forces to change what was taught and to teach in Russian, not Ukrainian.\nThe war has cost Ukraine $564.9 billion in damage and lost economic activity — roughly three times its prewar gross domestic product — Yulia Svyrydenko, the economy minister, said in a Facebook post on Monday.\nThere are as yet no reliable estimates of civilian casualties, and some four million people have fled the country, along with about six million who are internally displaced, according to the United Nations.",

      "headline": "Peace Talks May Be Little More Than Russian Tactics, Analysts Say",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks.html",
      "text": "BRUSSELS — As envoys made progress in peace talks on Tuesday, Russia offered concessions that signaled a more realistic course for the war in Ukraine, while indicating it is also in no hurry to end the conflict, according to diplomats and analysts.\nRussia’s deputy defense minister, Aleksandr Fomin, presented the decision to “sharply reduce” military activity around the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and the northern city of Chernihiv as a gesture “to increase mutual trust for future negotiations.”\nBut the Russian advance in the north had already stalled, with troops around Kyiv taking up defensive positions in the face of Ukrainian counterattacks, both there and near Sumy, where Russia has been having trouble encircling the main Ukrainian army east of the Dnieper River.\n“De-escalation is a euphemism for retreat,” said Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of War Studies at King’s College London. “Russia is adjusting its goals to reality, because war is quite empirical,” he said. “It’s not a ruse to say that they are concentrating on the Donbas, because in reality that’s all they can do.”\nBut retreat is hardly surrender, and others cautioned that the progress made Tuesday doesn’t mean that Russia is ready for serious discussions on ending the war. That would require a better outcome for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to sell at home as a victory.\nOn Tuesday, the Ukrainians outlined a 15-year process of negotiations about the status of Crimea, and said that control of the Donbas Region could be discussed in meetings between Mr. Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. Russia has said it would only set a meeting between the two presidents once a draft peace agreement was ready.\nSome analysts say such an agreement would, at minimum, have to give Russia control of Mariupol, the besieged port city in Ukraine that is still somehow holding out, to create a secure land route between two areas that Russia occupies: Crimea to the west, and the Donbas to the east. And it would also, they say, have to cede control over the two administrative regions in the Donbas, Luhansk and Donetsk, which Mr. Putin has already declared to be independent republics.\n“Russia is in no place to negotiate seriously because they have to do better in the war,” said François Heisbourg, a French defense analyst with the Foundation for Strategic Research. “This is a chance for the Russians to consolidate, to regroup, to remove themselves from places out of reach logistically, where they have already run out of food and ammunition.”\nSome senior Western officials agreed, saying that the Russians were badly short of artillery shells and other ammunition and needed to resupply.\nNor will Mr. Putin easily end the war, Mr. Heisbourg said. If he takes the area east of the Dnieper, “that may be enough for now, but he will rebuild his army and continue.”\nFor both sides, said Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, the London research institution, “the negotiations are not serious, in the sense that negotiations now for both sides are a continuation of the war, not a solution.” Russia can concentrate on the east, and Ukraine will find it hard to move from its agile defense to serious counterattacks, he said. “And Putin hasn’t forgotten about Kyiv.”\nEven if Mr. Putin can control and “settle” for another partition of Ukraine in the east, “Ukraine has to sign up for it, and if not, I don’t think we lift the sanctions,” Mr. Niblett said.\nHis colleague, Mathieu Boulègue, a French scholar who studies the Russian military, agrees that Russia is not negotiating in good faith, but “testing the waters and applying for time, to regroup and re-equip militarily and make more gains on the ground.”\nThe Russian military appears to have taken control of what might be called Phase 2 of a botched operation, he said, which should have been Phase 1. Taking Mariupol, the land bridge and the Donbas “would have been the grown-up military plan.” Modern warfare is half information warfare, Mr. Boulègue said, “and success is what you make of it,” especially in a repressive media environment as in Russia now.\nThe Russian forces’ inability to capture cities and keep territory is apparent after a month, he said, “so strategic goals have had to change.”\nBut to completely withdraw from Kyiv would allow the Ukrainians to reinforce the Donbas region and give them a significant victory, suggested Michael Kofman, director of Russia Studies at CNA, a defense research institution in Virginia, in a tweet.\nTraveling in Morocco, U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken also cast doubt on Russia’s pledge to reduce hostilities. “There is what Russia says and there’s what Russia does,” he said on Tuesday. “We’re focused on the latter. And what Russia is doing is the continued brutalization of Ukraine and its people and that continues as we speak.”\nRussia did not stop fighting after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, but actively supported the separatists in the Donbas, said Ian Bond, a former British diplomat in Russia and the head of foreign policy for the Center for European Reform. “I’m a skeptic about the Russians giving up on the war,” he said. “We’ve seen this movie before in 2014 and 2015. I view this as only a pause.”\nIan Garner, a historian of Russian propaganda, pointed out on Twitter that “Putin’s Russia — indeed, post-Soviet Russia — has been engaged in mucky, endless conflicts for years,” citing Transnistria in Moldova, Abkhazia in Georgia and the Donbas, all areas in other countries where Russian forces back separatist movements. “Not ended, maybe,” he said, but “in the intermission.”\nThe senior Ukrainian negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, suggested after the talks on Tuesday that the two sides were talking seriously about neutrality for Ukraine, a treaty guaranteeing its security by NATO member states like the United States, Britain, Turkey, France and Germany, a cease-fire and humanitarian corridors.\nUkrainian and Western officials also suggested that Russia would be willing for a demilitarized Ukraine to join the European Union, so long as it forswore joining NATO or hosting any foreign forces.\nBut security analysts questioned the sincerity of such an agreement.\nMr. Bond said that the problem with Ukraine’s notion of neutrality is that so far none of the countries it wants to guarantee it would agree to do so. It would be like NATO membership with collective defense by another name, so highly unlikely, he said.\nAs for European Union membership, Mr. Niblett said, that would represent the largest danger to Mr. Putin, who helped stimulate the 2014 revolt in Ukraine when he forced the then-president, Viktor Yanukovych, to renege on a trade agreement with the bloc. If Ukraine joined now, Mr. Niblett said, the country would develop economically even faster, in contrast to Russia, “and you would end up with a South Korea next to a North Korea, and I can’t see Putin accepting that.”\nEven more, he said, the European Union treaties contain a collective defense promise as well.\nStill, Mr. Boulègue said, the European Union needs to give Ukraine a clear response about its prospects for membership. “Whether that leads to E.U. membership or not is not for Russia to decide,” he said. “But the E.U. needs to be absolutely clear about the future of Ukraine going forward, it’s the moral thing to do.”",

      "headline": "How Russia Is Using Ukrainians’ Hunger as a Weapon of War",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/world/europe/mariupol-ukraine-russia-war-food-water.html",
      "text": "LVIV, Ukraine — After Russian forces surrounded the city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine, cutting off its water and fuel and preventing aid convoys from entering, Yulia Beley sheltered in a neighbor’s basement with her three daughters and struggled to survive.\nHer husband was off defending the city, so she ventured out as bombs rained down to fetch water from a distant well and tried to comfort her children while the shelling shook the walls and ceiling. In time, the family’s food dwindled and Ms. Beley, a baker, said she fed her hungry children one bowl of porridge a day to share between them. Her 6-year-old daughter, Ivanka, dreamed of the poppy seed sweet rolls her mother had made before the war.\n“It tears you apart,” said Ms. Beley, 33, still traumatized after her escape from the city a week ago. “I just sobbed, just cried, screaming into the pillow when no one could see.”\nShortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, it laid siege to Mariupol, using the ancient warfare tactic to try to starve the once-bustling city of 430,000 people into surrender.\nFrom the days when armies surrounded medieval castles in Europe to the battle of Stalingrad in World War II and the squeeze put on rebel communities in Syria during the 11-year civil war, militaries have used sieges throughout history regardless of the catastrophic effects on civilians caught in the middle.\nThis month, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken accused Russia of “starving” cities in Ukraine. He invoked the memory of the brother of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Viktor, who died in infancy during the German siege of Leningrad during World War II.\n“It is shameful,” Mr. Blinken said. “The world is saying to Russia: ‘Stop these attacks immediately. Let the food and medicine in. Let the people out safely, and end this war of choice against Ukraine.’”\nScholars of siege warfare say the tactic serves different purposes: to weaken enemies while avoiding clashes that can kill the besieging force’s own soldiers, or to freeze active fronts while attacking forces reposition. But the grueling nature of sieges — and how they use hunger to turn people’s own bodies against them — gives them a psychological power unique among war tactics, according to scholars and siege survivors.\n“Siege is a way to break the will and humiliate — and finally to control,” said Mouna Khaity, a health and gender researcher who lived through the Syrian government’s five-year siege of Eastern Ghouta, an area near Damascus.\nDepriving a residential area of food while bombarding it serves not only to flush out combatants, she said, but to communicate to everyone trapped inside: “You are not an equal human to me. You don’t deserve to eat, drink, have medicine or even breathe!”\nAfter they surrounded Mariupol last month, Russian forces cut off the city from everything it needed to live, the mayor, Vadym Boichenko, said on Ukrainian national television. They also destroyed the city’s power plants, cutting off electricity for residents as temperatures froze, Mr. Boichenko said, and then the water and gas, essential for cooking and heating.\nSome civilians managed to flee, making harrowing journeys through destroyed streets and Russian checkpoints. But about 160,000 people are believed to still be trapped inside the city, Mr. Boichenko said, and more than two dozen buses sent days ago to evacuate them had not been able to enter the city because of Russian shelling.\nOn Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was ceasing relief operations in Mariupol because the warring parties could not guarantee the safety of aid workers.\nAlmost 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed there, the mayor estimated, but the figures could not be confirmed because of the difficulty of getting information.\nRussian forces are in control of parts of Mariupol, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine told a group of independent Russian journalists on Sunday. But the center of the city continues to hold, according to Ukrainian and British military assessments.\nAn aide to the mayor, Pyotr Andryuschenko, told The New York Times that an estimated 3,000 Ukrainian fighters from the Azov Battalion were defending the city against about 14,000 Moscow-backed soldiers.\nWhen the siege began, one Mariupol resident, Kristina, said she, her husband and two children camped out in the entryway of their building, hoping it would provide better shelter and protection than their apartment.\nHer husband, a business analyst, ventured out to find water and she cooked on an open fire. They also collected rainwater and snow, boiling the water to sterilize it.\nShe read fairy tales to try to distract the children, but once they got hungry, “the fire was gone from their eyes,” said Kristina, who did not want to use her full name for fear of retribution. “They had no interest in anything.”\n“We ate once a day,” she said. “It was mostly in the morning or in the evening that the children cried out, saying, ‘I want to eat.’”\nHer family finally fled the city, but left behind her father and grandparents. She has struggled to keep tabs on them because the city’s phone networks are mostly out.\nLast week, she said, they sent a text that read: “No roof, no food and no water.”\nDoctors who study hunger and starvation describe a grim process of the body mining itself to stay alive. First, it burns glucose stored in the liver, then fat, then muscle.\nWhile dehydration can kill in less than a week, a well-nourished adult can survive for more than 70 days on water alone. Children, the elderly and the ill succumb more quickly.\nOther research has shown that starvation not only weakens the body but disturbs the mind.\nNancy Zucker, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University, said research done during World War II on 36 male conscientious objectors who ate a low calorie diet modeled on that given to prisoners of war showed they had suffered “significant psychological consequences.”\nShe added: “They had starvation neuroses — increased anxiety, increased isolation, increased depression.”\nThat damage compounds in traumatic circumstances, like wars.\n“This is starvation during a catastrophe,” she said. “It is very hard to separate the profound psychological consequences from being in a state of war from those of not having enough food.”\nThe memory of hunger haunted the conscientious objectors in the study long after they had regained their strength.\n“They needed to be surrounded by food,” and some remained obsessed with it, she said. “Several went on to become chefs.”\nIrina Peredey, a municipal worker from Mariupol, said that after she escaped, she was in such shock that she could not eat for days.\nAfter that, she began to crave a full meal about every hour.\n“An hour passes and you want to eat,” said Ms. Peredey, 29. “It seems to me psychological. You constantly start eating — and want to eat as much as possible.”\nAt first she was confused, she said.\n“But now I see that apparently, this is how my body is fighting back.”\nAs Ms. Beley, the baker, fought to survive in the basement in Mariupol, she said, bombs shook the building and shells were so common that even her daughter Aida, 3, learned to distinguish between incoming and outgoing fire.\nThe family soon ran out of food. Another woman gave her a jar of honey.\n“That’s how we survived,” she said. “We didn’t have food, but we can’t say we didn’t eat because a spoonful of honey once a day is already some kind of lunch.”\nWhen her family finally managed to escape, she felt weak, like her body was struggling to function. Russian soldiers offered candy to her and her children and at first, she refused. Then she changed her mind.\n“Give me candy, sugar,” she said. “I realized that I needed something so that I could maintain myself.”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/world/europe/polish-border-refugees.html",
      "text": "WARSAW — Ilona Yurchenkov, 28, sits on a black chair in a sprawling expo center on the outskirts of Warsaw, a Yankees hat on her head and her cat, Mars, in a pet carrier beside her. She left her home in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv when fighting began there, and she has been on the road for days.\n“Today, I had a long journey from the border to here, but all the way I feel people have helped me,” she said, adding that a woman had just shown her how to get to the veterinarian to have Mars checked. Now, she was waiting for a bus to continue on to Denmark.\nShe is one of 10,000 people who are using the expo center as a stop-off point after it was hastily set up in the last three weeks to provide support for people fleeing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. More than two million people have crossed the border into Poland, the United Nations confirmed late last week.\nThe flow of people has been enabled by the fact that the European Union has allowed Ukrainians fleeing the war to move across borders without visas and stay for up to three years, circumventing the often lengthy asylum process that refugees from elsewhere in the world face when entering the bloc.\nBut, so far, there are no refugee camps in Poland, thanks in some part to grass roots efforts by charities, businesses, individuals and local officials that pooled their resources to face the logistical challenge of providing for so many people so quickly and create places like the one at the expo center.\nMany of those who come here to the Polish capital, like Ms. Yurchenkov, will continue on to other countries — some who will meet up with friends and others who will rely on the kindness of strangers offering a place to stay. For now, they need shelter, food and somewhere to sleep after hours or days on the road.\nJakub Mroczkowski, a representative for the regional government, which helped organize the reception site, said that most of the visitors have stayed for a day or two to rest and have a hot meal before moving on. Some 25,000 people have come through the site so far.\nIt is only at half its capacity, but he expects it will become crowded as the humanitarian situation worsens.\n“We should be preparing for a long march,” Mr. Mroczkowski said, but, he added, he was amazed to see how many people from all over Europe had converged here and were dedicated to offering help.\nMost of the people providing aid are volunteers, charity workers, or the staff of the expo center. Inside there are play areas for children, a medical clinic, showers, toilets, charging stations and a canteen. Donated clothes, baby strollers, wheelchairs, diapers, pet carriers and other necessities are piled up in one corner.\nOne area has become a makeshift bus depot, with screens listing destinations where people can take free buses.\nGood Samaritans from across Europe are also bringing aid in, including a Hindu charity group from Britain that arrived on Friday with a truck packed with supplies. The group, from a temple called Swaminarayan Mandir, in northwestern England, felt drawn to find a way to help.\nIt had reached out to a local businesswoman woman, Kamilia Gorniak, who had been organizing donations on social media and had a warehouse where supplies could be stored. Then she connected the group with the expo center.\nMs. Gorniak said she felt proud to be Polish when she saw the countless donations, volunteers and those who have offered up spare rooms.\n“In this critical situation, we gathered together and, really, I don’t know anyone who is not helping,” she said.",

      "text": "ROME, March 21 (UPI).—Seven million farm and industrial workers walked out today in a strike barely noticed by the man in the street. But motorists were more concerned by refinery and filling station strikes which may cause an Easter season gasoline shortage.\nTwo of Italy’s poorest and most unemployment-prone groups, farmhands and construction workers, spearheaded today’s strikes.\nAbout 1.7 million farmhands staged their fifth 24-hour strike in four months to press demands for a new contract. Their demands included a request for a minimum daily wage of $4.72. Farm workers in 30 of Italy’s 94 provinces now make less than that.\nOther demands included a 40-hour work week instead of the current 42-hour week, and guarantees against dismissal. Farmhands currently are hired for two-month periods with no guarantee of prolongation of employment.\nLabor unions called out 5.5 million construction and industry workers in sympathy with the farmhands.\nThe construction workers, who have grievances of their own over pay, work accidents and unemployment, made it a 24-hour strike. Newspaper printers and chemical, textile, metal and food canning workers joined for periods ranging from two to four hours.\nSmaller Groups\nMost Italians were not affected by the strikes, apart from traffic jams caused by strikers’ marches in Rome, Milan, Naples and a dozen other cities.\nHowever, strikes by two smaller groups — refinery and filling station workers — caused greater concern.\nAbout 20,000 workers of private oil companies were in the second day of a 72-hour strike, the latest in a series which has reduced gasoline stocks in many refineries to a minimum.\nGasoline station attendants, demanding more money and shorter hours, called a new three-day strike starting at 9 p.m. today. Although one of the distributors’ three labor unions refused to join the strike call, labor experts said it was likely to be more effective than previous strikes, which sharply reduced the number of open filling stations.\nThe refinery strike also threatened to affect the cement industry, which is 85 percent powered by fuel oil. A number of cement plants reported their fuel stocks running out.\n— The International Herald Tribune, March 22, 1972",

      "headline": "No One Survived Flight 5735 Crash, China Says: What We Know",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/world/asia/china-eastern-crash-explained.html",
      "text": "China Eastern Airlines Flight 5735 was making a short trip between two cities in southern China on Monday, cruising at an altitude of more than 29,000 feet, when it began a violent plunge toward the earth. Residents in the area described hearing a boom, apparently from the plane crashing into a hillside, and then seeing smoke from the fires it had ignited.\nOn Saturday night, the Chinese authorities confirmed what had seemed all but certain for days: that none of the 132 people aboard had survived. “It was in fragments scattered all around,” Li Chenbin, a technician in the area, told the China News Service soon after the crash. “I didn’t see anyone who lived through it.”\nOfficials said Saturday that 120 of the victims had been identified. Workers were still searching the crash site in the Guangxi region for debris. On Sunday, officials said the second of the Boeing 737-800’s two flight recorders, or “black boxes,” had been found. \nMany questions remain about what led to the crash. It was China’s deadliest air disaster since 1994, when a plane went down near the city of Xi’an, killing 160. Here’s a look at what we know so far:\nFlight 5735 took off shortly after 1 p.m. on Monday and the first hour of its journey proceeded as normal, Zhu Tao, the director of aviation safety at the Civil Aviation Administration of China, said late Tuesday. The plane was cruising at about 29,000 feet around 2:17 p.m., but a few minutes later air traffic controllers noticed the aircraft had suddenly lost altitude.\nThe plane lost more than 20,000 feet in just over a minute, according to Flightradar24, a tracking platform. \nAir traffic controllers immediately called the plane crew, Mr. Zhu said, but did not receive a reply after several attempts. By 2:23 p.m., the plane’s radar signal disappeared, he said, and it had crashed.\nMr. Zhu acknowledged that officials had uncovered little information so far.\n“The aircraft was severely damaged in this accident, and the investigation is very difficult,” he said. “With the information currently available, it is still impossible to make a clear judgment on the cause of the accident.”\nThe plane’s sudden dive occurred near a point in the route where it would normally begin its initial descent, according to Flightradar24’s records. The 675-mile flight from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province in southwest China, to Guangzhou, a major city in the southeastern province of Guangdong, usually takes about two hours. It crashed in Teng County in Guangxi.\nIt is relatively rare for a plane to crash while cruising or during its initial descent. While cruising takes up more than half of the time commercial planes spend in the air, only 13 percent of fatal accidents happen during this stage, according to a Boeing report on data from 2011 through 2020. Just 3 percent of fatal crashes occur during the initial descent.\nThe plane was a Boeing 737-800 that had flown for nearly seven years. It was not a 737 Max, the model that was grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that were caused by a faulty flight stabilizing system.\nThe 737-800 is part of Boeing’s Next Generation series. It is a narrow-body model, with nearly 5,000 built since it first went into production in the late 1990s. The widely used model has a good safety record, with 22 hull-losses, meaning the plane was damaged beyond economical repair, recorded over the past two decades, according to the Aviation Safety Network database.\nFlight 5735’s pilot, identified in news reports as Yang Hongda, was an industry veteran, and his first co-pilot, Zhang Zhengping, had even more experience, with a record dating to the 1980s. A second co-pilot was also on the flight; in total, the three had put in more than 39,000 hours of flying time. \nChina Eastern did not confirm the names of the crew members, but it said they had no health problems or faults on their records. One official with the airline said their “family conditions were stable.” Experts said crash investigators would consider the possibility that the plane, which took a sudden, steep dive in good weather, had been brought down intentionally. But they said it was far too early to jump to any conclusions.\nChina Eastern, the country’s second-largest carrier, had a checkered record in its early years, with multiple deadly crashes in the late 1980s and 1990s. In 1989, a China Eastern flight lost power after takeoff in Shanghai, killing 34. And in 1993, an error by a crew member forced an emergency landing in Alaska that killed two passengers.\nIn 2004, a buildup of ice on the wings of a China Eastern plane flying from Baotou in Inner Mongolia caused it to crash, killing 55. Since then, the airline’s safety record has drastically improved, with no fatal crashes before Monday, according to flight safety databases.\nThe airline’s safety history mirrors that of China as a whole. In the 1990s the country was considered one of the most dangerous places in the world to fly. But after officials carried out a regulatory overhaul, the country has maintained an admirable safety record. The country’s last major crash before Monday was in 2010.\nThe Civil Aviation Administration of China said on Monday that it activated an emergency mechanism as soon as it received reports of the crash and sent a team to the site to begin an investigation. The agency also said it would require “more industrywide efforts to improve aviation safety.”\nBoeing, the plane’s manufacturer, said Monday that it was in contact with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board about the crash, and the manufacturer’s technical experts were prepared to assist the Civil Aviation Administration of China in its investigation.\nThe initial investigation will focus on information from the flight recorders, which collect data on the plane’s performance and record the pilots’ communications. Experts will also study video records that have emerged, including security footage from a mining company that appeared to show a plane heading directly toward the earth.\nBecause airplanes are so technologically complex, the cause of a crash is always difficult to identify and always multilayered, experts said. Official reports on a crash’s cause can take months, or longer, to complete.\n“It’s never one thing,” said Thomas R. Anthony, the director of the aviation safety and security program at the University of Southern California. “There may be one thing that’s obvious, there may be one primary thing, but it’s never one thing.”",

      "text": "Russia would consider using its nuclear weapons if it felt there was “an existential threat for our country,” a Kremlin spokesman said in an English-language television interview on Tuesday. The spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, made the comment after describing Ukraine, the neighboring country Russia invaded a month ago, as having been created by anti-Russian Western powers.\nMr. Peskov was speaking in an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. Video excerpts from the interview were posted on her Twitter account.\nIn it, Ms. Amanpour asked Mr. Peskov several times whether Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, intended to use nuclear weapons.\nMr. Peskov initially replied by characterizing the invasion of Ukraine as a defensive move to protect Russia. “President Putin intends to make the world listen to and understand our concerns,” Mr. Peskov said. “But no one would listen to us.”\nUkraine, he added, “was formed by the Western countries, anti-Russia.” After Ms. Amanpour audibly sighed, Mr. Peskov added, “This is the problem.”\nPutin’s possible use of nuclear weapons has been a concern for the United States and NATO members as they consider how to defend Ukraine without escalating the conflict with Russia. Days after the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Putin announced that he was putting his nuclear forces into “special combat readiness,” which is a heightened alert status reminiscent of some of the most dangerous moments of the Cold War.\nWhen Ms. Amanpour asked again about Putin’s potential for using nuclear weapons, Mr. Peskov referred to Russia’s “concept of domestic security,” which he said is a publicly available document.\n“You can read all the reasons for nuclear arms to be used,” he said. “So, if it is an existential threat for our country, then it can be used in accordance with our concern.”\nMs. Amanpour concluded that portion of the interview by saying Mr. Peskov was being purposely vague.\n“I still don’t know whether I have a full answer from you,” she said, “and I’m just going to assume from you that President Putin wants to scare the world and keep the world on tenterhooks.”\nThe interview left some room to interpret where Russia stood on the matter. A CNN headline declared that Mr. Peskov “refuses to rule out” the use of nuclear weapons. A Reuters news service headline, hedging slightly, announced, “Kremlin: Russia would only use nuclear weapons if its existence were threatened.”",

      "headline": "As Russia Stalls in Ukraine, Dissent Brews Over Putin’s Leadership",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/world/europe/putin-russia-military-planning.html",
      "text": "In January, the head of a group of serving and retired Russian military officers declared that invading Ukraine would be “pointless and extremely dangerous.” It would kill thousands, he said, make Russians and Ukrainians enemies for life, risk a war with NATO and threaten “the existence of Russia itself as a state.”\nTo many Russians, that seemed like a far-fetched scenario, since few imagined that an invasion of Ukraine was really possible. But two months later, as Russia’s advance stalls in Ukraine, the prophecy looms large. Reached by phone this week, the retired general who authored the declaration, Leonid Ivashov, said he stood by it, though he could not speak freely given Russia’s wartime censorship: “I do not disavow what I said.”\nIn Russia, the slow going and the heavy toll of President Vladimir V. Putin’s war on Ukraine are setting off questions about his military’s planning capability, his confidence in his top spies and loyal defense minister, and the quality of the intelligence that reaches him. It also shows the pitfalls of Mr. Putin’s top-down governance, in which officials and military officers have little leeway to make their own decisions and adapt to developments in real time.\nThe failures of Mr. Putin’s campaign are apparent in the striking number of senior military commanders believed to have been killed in the fighting. Ukraine says it has killed at least six Russian generals, while Russia acknowledges one of their deaths, along with that of the deputy commander of its Black Sea fleet. American officials say they cannot confirm the number of Russian troop deaths, but that Russia’s invasion plan appears to have been stymied by bad intelligence.\nThe lack of progress is so apparent that a blame game has begun among some Russian supporters of the war — even as Russian propaganda claims that the slog is a consequence of the military’s care to avoid harming civilians. Igor Girkin, a former colonel in Russia’s F.S.B. intelligence agency and the former “defense minister” of Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, said in a video interview posted online on Monday that Russia had made a “catastrophically incorrect assessment” of Ukraine’s forces.\n“The enemy was underestimated in every aspect,” Mr. Girkin said.\nThe Russian forces’ poor performance has also surprised analysts, who predicted at the start of the war that Russia’s massive, technologically advanced military would make short work of Ukraine. Mr. Putin himself seems to have counted on his troops quickly seizing major cities, including the capital, Kyiv, decapitating the government and installing a puppet regime under the Kremlin’s control.\n“Take power into your own hands,” Mr. Putin urged Ukrainian soldiers on the second day of the invasion, apparently hoping Ukraine would go down without a fight.\nInstead, Ukraine fought back. Nearly a month has passed, and Russian troops appear bogged down in the face of relentless attacks from a much weaker, though far more maneuverable, Ukrainian military. \n“There was probably the hope that they wouldn’t resist so intensely,” Yevgeny Buzhinsky, ​​a retired lieutenant general and a regular Russian state television commentator, said of Ukraine’s forces. “They were expected to be more reasonable.”\nAs if responding to criticism, Mr. Putin has said repeatedly in his public comments about the war that it is going “according to plan.”\n“We can definitively say that nothing is going to plan,” countered Pavel Luzin, a Russian military analyst. “It has been decades since the Soviet and Russian armies have seen such great losses in such a short period of time.”\nRussia last announced its combat losses three weeks ago — 498 deaths as of March 2. American officials now say that a conservative estimate puts the Russian military death toll at 7,000. Russia says it lost a total of 11,000 service members in nearly a decade of fighting in Chechnya.\nThe failures in Ukraine have started to create fissures within Russian leadership, according to Andrei Soldatov, an author and expert on Russia’s military and security services. The top Russian intelligence official in charge of overseeing the recruitment of spies and diversionary operations in Ukraine has been put under house arrest along with his deputy, Mr. Soldatov said. Even Russia’s defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, who vacations with Mr. Putin and has been spoken of as a potential presidential successor, has suffered a loss of standing, according to Mr. Soldatov’s sources.\n“It looks like everybody is on edge,” Mr. Soldatov said.\nMr. Soldatov’s claims could not be independently verified, and some independent experts have challenged them. But Mr. Shoigu has not been shown meeting with Mr. Putin in person since Feb. 27, when he and his top military commander, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, sat at the end of a long table as Mr. Putin, on the opposite end, ordered them to place Russia’s nuclear forces at a higher level of readiness.\n“The war has shown that the army fights poorly,” Mr. Luzin, the Russian military analyst, said. “The defense minister is responsible for this.”\nThe battlefield deaths of senior Russian commanders also reflect poorly on the Kremlin’s war planning. Captain Andrei Paliy, the deputy commander of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, died in combat over the port city of Mariupol, Russian officials said on Sunday.\nAfter Maj. Gen. Andrei Sukhovetsky, the deputy commander of the 41st Combined Arms Army, was killed four days into the war, the city of Novorossiysk, where he was previously based, issued a statement remembering him as “a faithful comrade, a valiant warrior, a wise commander and a selfless defender of the Fatherland.”\n“Epaulets give no protection to terrorists,” Ukraine’s military intelligence service said in its statement announcing General Sukhovetsky’s death.\nThere was also Maj. Gen. Oleg Mityayev, among the Russian military’s most seasoned commanders. He had led Russia’s largest foreign military base in Tajikistan and was second in command of Russia’s forces in Syria. When Mr. Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine, General Mityayev was tapped to lead the storied 150th Motorized Rifle Division, whose soldiers helped take the Reichstag building in Berlin precipitating Nazi Germany’s defeat in 1945.\nAccording to Kyiv, he lasted less than three weeks in Ukraine. After he was killed in battle, either Russian forces left his body behind, or it was captured by the far-right Azov Battalion, which posted a photo of the bloody corpse on Telegram with the caption, “Glory to Ukraine.”\nRussian officials have not confirmed his death — or those of another four generals that Ukraine claims to have killed. But even accounting for the fog of war, experts say that Russia has suffered a damaging death toll among its military leaders on the ground in Ukraine, which could soon erode Russia’s military effectiveness.\nThe deaths reflect operational security failures as well as the challenges of the Russian military’s top-heavy command structure in the face of a much nimbler Ukrainian fighting force.\n“In modern warfare, you don’t have a lot of generals getting knocked off,” said Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe. “But this is a very lethal battlefield.”\nGeneral Joseph L. Votel, the former commander of U.S. Central Command, said that the deaths could reflect Russia’s challenges on the ground — and reports that some Russian units did not understand the mission at hand and had even abandoned equipment. As a result, he said, military leaders appeared to be operating closer to the front to “supervise and keep their troops in the fight, by personal example or intimidation.”\n“Continuing to lose senior leaders is not good,” he said in an email. “Eventually, loss of leadership affects morale, fighting prowess and effectiveness.”\nFor Russia’s generals, part of the problem is that many of them have spent recent decades fighting a different type of war. In Chechnya at the beginning of the 2000s, Russia succeeded in pacifying a separatist uprising in a small territory by resorting to scorched-earth decimation of entire cities. More recently in Syria, Russia’s operations have been driven by airstrikes against a population that lacks sophisticated weapons or even a regular army.\nUkraine, while far weaker militarily, has been learning from its eight-year war against Russian-backed separatist forces in the country’s east — a similar war, in miniature, to the one being fought now. Ukraine has its own air force, which remains largely intact, and modern antiaircraft systems. As convoys of Russian armor have lumbered along Ukrainian highways, Ukrainian forces have deployed drones and highly maneuverable infantry units to devastating effect, leaving abandoned and burning vehicles.\nThroughout Ukraine, Russian forces have now largely stalled. But analysts caution that the military setbacks will not deter Mr. Putin — who has cast the war at home as an existential one for Russia, and is increasingly signaling to the Russian public to prepare for a long fight.\nThe question is whether heavy losses and the pain of Western sanctions could force Mr. Putin to accept some kind of compromise to end the war — and whether President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine would be prepared to offer concessions to satisfy him. On Tuesday, Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, played down any hopes of an imminent cease-fire, describing talks with Ukraine as going “much more slowly and less substantively than we would like.”\n“The Russian leadership can’t lose,” said Andrei Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a research organization close to the Russian government. “No matter what, they will need to end this whole story with some kind of victory.”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/world/middleeast/egypt-israel-united-arab-emirates-summit.html",
      "text": "CAIRO — Egypt hosted the first summit meeting with leaders of Israel and the United Arab Emirates on Monday and Tuesday, the latest sign of a swift realignment of Middle Eastern political alliances since Israel established diplomatic relations in 2020 with several Arab countries.\nGovernments in all three countries were circumspect on what Israel’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett; the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed; and Egypt’s president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, discussed at their meeting in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh.\nIsrael said only that they had focused on ways to strengthen the relationships among the three countries, and a spokesman for Egypt’s presidency, apparently wary of lingering domestic hostility toward Israel, described talks between the Emirati leader and the Egyptian president without even mentioning Mr. Bennett.\nBut the deliberately vague statements obscured an important development in the region, analysts said, as the Middle Eastern powers appeared to band together to navigate their fraught relationships with the Biden administration, amid the quickly changing geopolitical landscape precipitated by Russia’s war on Ukraine.\nAll three countries have faced heavy pressure from Washington to shun Russia and, in the Emirates’ case, also to supply more oil to a world trying to wean itself from Russian energy.\nThat arm-twisting has come as the United States pursues a renewed nuclear deal with Iran, a rival of both Israel and the U.A.E., that would lift international sanctions on Tehran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program. The Emirates and another important American ally in the region, Saudi Arabia, have complained about what they see as a lack of American support after attacks that were linked to Iran.\n“It’s quite interesting to see them saying that, from now on, we are going to talk like one team,” said Abdulkhaleq Abdulla, an Emirati political analyst. “They want to send not an individual message, but a collective message, and it is both to Iran and to America. The combined forces of these major regional U.S. allies will be heard better than each one of them talking to Washington alone.”\nFor decades, Israel was ostracized by all but two Arab countries, Jordan and Egypt. For most Arab governments, Israel’s occupation of territories claimed by the Palestinians precluded any diplomatic entente and even in those capitals, Amman and Cairo, leaders sought to keep their relationships with Israel below the radar.\nBut the very public summit in Sharm el Sheikh highlighted how the advantages of greater economic ties with Israel and the shared fear of a nuclear Iran now seem to be greater immediate priorities to some Arab leaders than a quick resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nNuclear talks among the United States, five other global powers and Iran have been nearing a resolution but currently hinge on a sticky Iranian demand: that Washington stop designating the country’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, its powerful military force, as a terrorist organization.\nIsrael and Washington’s other Middle East allies have lobbied the Biden administration not to give in, saying they fear that doing so would strengthen Iran-backed groups across the region, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen.\nCooperation is speeding up on other fronts as well. The meeting in Sharm el Sheikh followed Mr. Bennett’s visits to Bahrain in February and to the Emirates in December, both firsts for an Israeli prime minister.\nAmid the warming Emirati-Israeli ties, the fact that Egypt hosted the summit suggests it is playing catch-up, said Nimrod Novik, an analyst at the Israel Policy Forum, a research group, and an expert on Israeli-Egyptian relations.\nCairo is less concerned about the Iran deal than the others, said H.A. Hellyer, a Middle East scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute. But it may see an opportunity to regain its historic role as a mediator.\n“The Egyptians were less than happy in losing their presumed role as liaisons between Israel and the Arab world,” Mr. Novik said. “As far as Sisi is concerned, this is a marker that says: ‘We remain relevant to the emerging, new context.’”\nThanks to the Ukraine war, Egypt is also looking to step up its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, something it cannot accomplish without Israel, which provides much of the raw gas that Egypt processes and re-exports, said Abdelmonem Said Aly, a political analyst and writer aligned with the Egyptian government.\nThe Ukraine war has rocked the Middle East on several fronts, including by pushing up food prices and threatening economies across the region, making regional collaboration more urgent, he said.\nIts economy shaken by the Ukraine war, Egypt hopes to attract Israeli tourists to its Red Sea resorts and to drum up Persian Gulf investment in the country. Both efforts are already seeing some success: Israel and Egypt just announced new direct flights between Israel and Sharm el Sheikh, and Emirati investors said this week that they would buy up large chunks of Egyptian banks.\nIsraeli media reported that Mr. Bennett’s visit was the first time that an Israeli prime minister had stayed overnight in Egypt in two decades.\nAnalysts said the leaders may also have discussed how to limit the risk of a flare-up in the occupied territories in the coming weeks, when the convergence of the Muslim festival of Ramadan, the Christian holiday of Easter and the Jewish Passover is likely to raise tensions.\nEgypt has often mediated between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls Gaza, including during last year’s 11-day war in Gaza, which followed a period of heightened tensions around Ramadan.\n“The Egyptians and the Emiratis and others are concerned about the convergence of the three holidays, and they do not want to see a reincarnation of what happened last May, or perhaps worse,” Mr. Novik said.\nMr. Hellyer said the tripartite warmth may prove to be only temporary, given the three countries’ varying interests.\nThe leaders also discussed another source of tension between the United States and its Arab allies: the gradual emergence of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, from his long regional isolation. Mr. al-Assad has spent a decade out in the cold because of his brutal crackdown on his own people during the Syrian civil war.\nAnd after quiet signs over the last few years that Arab countries were willing to resume relations with the Syrian leader, he visited the Emirati capital last week.\nThe meeting in Egypt this week raised the question of whether the fallout from the war in Ukraine will reshape the region’s alliances in a more lasting way.\n“Whether this is the basis for a lasting triumvirate is unclear,” Mr. Hellyer said. “Only time will tell.”",

      "text": "BASTAD, Sweden — Two teachers were killed at a high school in Malmo in southern Sweden, and a student was arrested on suspicion of murder, the police said Tuesday. The motive for the attack was unclear.\nThe police found both victims, two women in their 50s, injured at Malmo Latin School late Monday, after getting a report of an attack there, Petra Stenkula, the head of the Malmo police, said at a news conference. The women died of their injuries later Monday.\nThe police arrested an 18-year-old man on the scene, and Ms. Stenkula said they were investigating whether he called the police himself. The police declined to identify the man.\nSwedish news media reported that the attacker had been carrying an ax, a knife and a hammer, but Ms. Stenkula said police were still waiting for a forensic examination to determine the weapon used.\nSuch crimes are uncommon in Sweden, but in the past year there has been a series of attacks in the country’s schools.\nOn Jan. 10, the police arrested a 16-year-old student after he knifed a teacher and a fellow student at a high school in the city of Kristianstad in southern Sweden. Last August a masked 15-year-old boy with a camera on his helmet knifed a teacher at a middle school in Eslov, an attack that a prosecutor said was a hate crime, according to the Aftonbladet newspaper. Both victims survived the attacks.\nMs. Stenkula said it was too early to determine the motive for Monday’s murder or the relationship between the teachers and the student.\n“It is deeply tragic because young people in their best developmental years are affected by this terribly,” said Sven-Erik Alhem, a former prosecutor and chairman of Victim Support Sweden, an advocacy group, who is also a former student at Malmo Latin School. “We associate school with safety and learning, and not with violence.”",

      "text": "As Russian forces struggled to make progress across Ukraine, losing control of a contested town west of the capital, Moscow advanced on a different front on Tuesday, expanding the toughest crackdown on dissent during President Vladimir V. Putin’s 22 years in power.\nIn what appeared to be a signal move in that expansion, a Russian court sentenced the already imprisoned opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny to nine years in prison on fraud charges. The verdict was widely seen as a way to keep him behind bars as the Kremlin tries to tightly control the war’s narrative at home amid glimmers of defiance. Mr. Navalny has been urging Russians to protest the invasion via letters from jail that his lawyers post on social media. \nThe move came as Russia amended an already draconian censorship law to make “discrediting” the activities abroad of all government bodies — not just the military — a potentially criminal offense. The law punishes anyone spreading “false information” about the invasion with up to 15 years in prison. Russia has taken other moves to quell information, including blocking access to Facebook. \nOn the ground, Ukrainians continued to mount a spirited defense of the capital, Kyiv, and said they had raised the blue and gold Ukrainian flag over Makariv, a town about 40 miles to the west, where control has gone back and forth between Russian forces and Ukrainians. Tuesday’s announcement reflected Ukrainian efforts to keep Russian forces from encircling Kyiv. After 26 days of fighting, a senior U.S. defense department official said that the Russians had not been able to advance beyond nine miles northwest of Kyiv or 18 miles from the city’s east — essentially where they were last week.\nIn other major developments:",

      "text": "JERUSALEM — Four Israelis were killed in a knife and car-ramming attack in Beersheba, in southern Israel, on Tuesday afternoon, in the third attack on Israeli Jews in less than a week.\nThe attacker rammed and killed a cyclist with his car outside a gas station, before entering the station and stabbing a woman to death, a police commander, Peretz Amar, said in a briefing near the crime scene.\nThe attacker returned to his car, drove to a nearby shopping center and stabbed three women, one of whom died, the commander said. The attacker then drove to a nearby roundabout, crashed into a second car, got out and stabbed to death a fourth civilian, the commander said.\nTwo armed passers-by tried to pacify the attacker before shooting him when he tried to stab one of them, according to video uploaded to social media on Tuesday evening. The attacker later died of his wounds, the police spokesman said.\nThe attack was the latest instance of an uptick in stabbing attacks by Palestinians across the country in recent weeks. A Jewish jogger was stabbed and injured on Saturday while running through a residential district of West Jerusalem. A day later, two Israeli police officers were stabbed and injured in East Jerusalem.\nThe attack was the first of its kind in Beersheba since 2015. A sleepy city at the northern end of the Negev desert, Beersheba is not usually at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but it has become more prominent in recent months because of tensions over the ownership of nearby land claimed by Arab Bedouin.\nThe spate of recent attacks has heightened fears of violence in April — when the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, the Jewish holiday of Passover and the Christian holiday of Easter unusually all fall at the same time. Ramadan is often a period of high tension in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza; tensions related to Ramadan helped stoke the Gaza war last May, and officials and analysts fear the convergence of three religious festivals could further inflame relations.\nThe Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, met with the leaders of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, on Tuesday. The three did not explain in detail the substance of their discussion, but analysts said at least part of the focus was the possibility of violence in East Jerusalem and the West Bank in the coming weeks.\nThe Jordanian king, Abdullah II, is also expected to visit the West Bank later this month in a bid to lower tensions, Palestinian officials said this week.\nThe attack in Beersheba followed nearby protests and clashes between Arab citizens of Israel and the Israeli police. Bedouin residents of the area are resisting attempts by Israel to plant a forest on what some Bedouin families say is their ancestral land — a disagreement that to many Palestinians is emblematic of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel says the families never had legal ownership of the plots.\nThe attack on Tuesday was praised by two Islamist militant groups, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, though neither claimed responsibility. Israeli media reported that the attacker was a teacher from a nearby Bedouin town who had served a jail term after admitting support for the Islamic State, the terrorist group that once controlled large parts of Iraq and Syria.\nLeading Arab politicians in Israel condemned the attack, including Mansour Abbas, an Islamist leader who made history last year by becoming the first Arab Israeli to lead an independent Arab party into a governing coalition.\nMr. Abbas wrote on social media that his party, Raam, “condemns the criminal terror attack” and “extends its condolences to the families of the murdered and wishes a full recovery to the injured.”\nHe added: “The Arab citizens of the state are law abiding and denounce anyone who uses violence against other citizens. Raam calls on all citizens to protect the delicate fabric of joint life, to show responsibility and to advance tolerant discourse at this difficult hour.”",

      "headline": "How Ukraine’s Outgunned Air Force Is Fighting Back Against Russian Jets",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/22/world/europe/ukraine-air-force-russia.html",
      "text": "LVIV, Ukraine — Each night, Ukrainian pilots like Andriy loiter in an undisclosed aircraft hangar, waiting, waiting, until the tension is broken with a shouted, one-word command: “Air!”\nAndriy hustles into his Su-27 supersonic jet and hastily taxis toward the runway, getting airborne as quickly as possible. He takes off so fast that he doesn’t yet know his mission for the night, though the big picture is always the same — to bring the fight to a Russian Air Force that is vastly superior in numbers but has so far failed to win control of the skies above Ukraine.\n“I don’t do any checks,” said Andriy, a Ukrainian Air Force pilot who as a condition of granting an interview was not permitted to give his surname or rank. “I just take off.”\nNearly a month into the fighting, one of the biggest surprises of the war in Ukraine is Russia’s failure to defeat the Ukrainian Air Force. Military analysts had expected Russian forces to quickly destroy or paralyze Ukraine’s air defenses and military aircraft, yet neither has happened. Instead, Top Gun-style aerial dogfights, rare in modern warfare, are now raging above the country.\n“Every time when I fly, it’s for a real fight,” said Andriy, who is 25 and has flown 10 missions in the war. “In every fight with Russian jets, there is no equality. They always have five times more” planes in the air.\nThe success of Ukrainian pilots has helped protect Ukrainian soldiers on the ground and prevented wider bombing in cities, since pilots have intercepted some Russian cruise missiles. Ukrainian officials also say the country’s military has shot down 97 fixed-wing Russian aircraft. That number could not be verified but the crumpled remnants of Russian fighter jets have crashed into rivers, fields and houses.\nThe Ukrainian Air Force is operating in near total secrecy. Its fighter jets can fly from air strips in western Ukraine, airports that have been bombed yet retain enough runway for takeoffs or landings — or even from highways, analysts say. They are vastly outnumbered: Russia is believed to fly some 200 sorties per day while Ukraine flies five to 10.\nUkrainian pilots do have one advantage. In most of the country, Russian planes fly over territory controlled by the Ukrainian military, which can move anti-aircraft missiles to harass — and shoot down — planes.\n“Ukraine has been effective in the sky because we operate on our own land,” Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force said. “The enemy flying into our airspace is flying into the zone of our air defense systems.” He described the strategy as luring Russian planes into air defense traps.\nDave Deptula, dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies and the principal attack planner for the Desert Storm air campaign in Iraq, said the impressive performance of the Ukrainian pilots had helped counter their disadvantages in numbers. He said Ukraine now has roughly 55 operational fighter jets, a number that is dwindling from shoot-downs and mechanical failures, as Ukrainian pilots are “stressing them to max performance.”\nUkraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has appealed repeatedly to Western governments to replenish the Ukrainian Air Force and has asked NATO to enforce a no-fly zone over the country, a step Western leaders have so far refused to take. Slovakia and Poland have considered sending MiG-29 fighter jets, which Ukrainian pilots could fly with minimal additional training, but as yet no transfers have been made.\n“Russian troops have already fired nearly 1,000 missiles at Ukraine, countless bombs,” Mr. Zelensky said in a video address to Congress on March 16, appealing for more planes. “And you know that they exist, and you have them, but they are on earth, not in Ukraine — in the Ukrainian sky.”\nMr. Deptula said transferring these jets into Ukraine is critical. “Without resupply,” he said, “they will run out of airplanes before they run out of pilots.”\nPilotless drones are also a tool in the Ukrainian military’s arsenal, but not in the battle for control of the airspace. Ukraine flies a Turkish-made armed drone, the Bayraktar TB-2, a plodding, propeller aircraft that is lethally effective in destroying tanks or artillery pieces on the ground but cannot hit targets in the air. If Ukraine’s air defenses fail, Russian jets could easily pick them off.\nAs in other aspects of Ukraine’s war effort, volunteers play a role in the air battles. A volunteer network watches and listens for Russian jets, calling in coordinates and estimated speed and altitude. Other private Ukrainian pilots have removed up-to-date civilian navigation equipment from their planes and handed it over to the air force, in case it can be helpful.\nAir-to-air combat has been rare in modern war, with only isolated examples in recent decades. U.S. pilots, for example, have not flown extensive aerial dogfights since the first Iraq War in 1991. Since then, U.S. fighter jets have engaged in air-to-air combat on just a few occasions, shooting down 10 planes in the Balkan wars and one plane in Syria, according to Mr. Deptula.\nIn the night sky, Andriy said he relies on instruments to discern the positions of enemy planes, which he says are always present. He has shot down Russian jets but was not permitted to say how many, or of which type. He said his targeting system can fire at planes a few dozen miles away.\n“I mostly have tasks of hitting airborne targets, of intercepting enemy jets,” he said. “I wait for the missile to lock on my target. After that I press fire.”\nWhen he shoots down a Russian jet, he said, “I am happy that this plane will no longer bomb my peaceful towns. And as we see in practice, that is exactly what Russian jets do.”\nMost of the aerial combat in Ukraine has been nocturnal, as Russian aircraft attack in the dark when they are less vulnerable to air defenses. In the dogfights over Ukraine, Andriy said, the Russians have been flying an array of modern Sukhoi jets, such as the Su-30, Su-34 and Su-35.\n“I had situations when I was approaching a Russian plane to a close enough distance to target and fire,” he said. “I could already detect it but was waiting for my missile to lock on while at the same time from the ground they tell me that a missile was fired at me already.”\nHe said he maneuvered his jet through a series of extreme banks, dives and climbs in order to exhaust the fuel supplies of the missiles coming after him. “The time I have to save myself depends on how far away the missile was fired at me and what kind of missile,” he said.\nStill, he said in an interview on a clear, sunny day, “I can still feel a huge rush of adrenaline in my body because every flight is a fight.”\nAndriy graduated from the Kharkiv Air Force School after deciding to become a pilot as a teenager. “Neither me nor my friends ever thought we would have to face a real war,” he said. “But that’s not how it turned out.”\nAndriy has moved his wife to a safer part of Ukraine, but she has not left the country, he said. She spends her days weaving homemade camouflage nets for the Ukrainian army. He never tells family members when he is going on duty, he said, calling only after returning from a night flight.\n“I only have to use my skills to win,” said Andriy. “My skills are better than the Russians. But on the other hand, many of my friends, and even those more experienced than me, are already dead.”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/world/europe/european-leaders-ukraine-trip.html",
      "text": "KYIV, Ukraine — The leaders of three eastern members of the European Union traveled to Kyiv on Tuesday on a high-risk mission that was kept under wraps until after they had boarded a train to the embattled Ukrainian capital.\nPoland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, posted photos on Facebook of the men sitting round a table and poring over maps, and the Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, did the same on Twitter. \n“It is here, in war-torn Kyiv, that history is being made,” Mr. Morawiecki wrote. “It is here, that freedom fights against the world of tyranny. It is here that the future of us all hangs in the balance.”\nLater in the day, Ukrainian media aired video footage of President Volodymyr Zelensky, in what has become his signature khaki green T-shirt and fleece, striding into a meeting room and sitting down with Mr. Morawiecki, Mr. Fiala and the prime minister of Slovenia.\n“Your visit to Kyiv at this difficult time for Ukraine is a strong sign of support — we appreciate it,” Mr. Zelensky said in a statement released with the footage.\nThe photos released by European leaders earlier sought to convey a daring show of support for Ukraine three weeks after Russian troops invaded the country, and as the mayor of Kyiv warned of growing danger for the capital and its inhabitants.\nThe symbolism was powerful.\nThe Czech and Polish people were subjugated by the former Soviet Union and lived through decades of communist rule. Now, alarm has been growing that President Vladimir V. Putin is seeking to turn back the clock more than 30 years and trying to reclaim the lost Soviet sphere of influence.\nThe European leaders were reported to have traveled by train from the Polish border, a journey of at least seven hours. Ukrainian officials released few details about the trip.\nUkraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, writing on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon, embraced the visitors. “The courage of true friends of Ukraine,” he said. “Discussing support of Ukraine and strengthening sanctions against Russian aggression.”\nThere was no indication that Moscow had guaranteed safe passage for the prime ministers. Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said that the governments of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia had not been in touch with the Kremlin about Tuesday’s trip.\nThe mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, visiting a burning apartment building hit in one of Tuesday’s strikes, applauded the visitors.\n“Keep supporting Ukraine,” he said, “because we are fighting now not for Ukraine. This war touched everyone in the world, especially the European Union, the European family.”\nMr. Klitschko warned that his city — and the whole country — face great danger in coming days. Earlier, his office announced a two-day curfew for the capital.\nOn Tuesday, firefighters in Kyiv battled a fierce blaze in a 16-story apartment block for most of the day after a missile gouged a big crater at its entrance. They rescued residents through apartment windows by ladder through the thick smoke and later went back for some of the pets had been left behind. By midafternoon they had carried out two bodies in black body bags.\nSome of the survivors sat on benches, reluctant to leave even as the authorities offered to take them to a refuge.\n“There was a huge roar and all the windows shattered,” Yelena Derevyanko said. She and her husband, Vadym, lived on the 16th floor and were rescued by firefighters.\nOne of their neighbors, Mykola Fedkiv, a retired geologist, stood waiting all day hoping to get back into his apartment to collect his personal documents. “I came out with nothing,” he said. “I left everything: My telephone, my medicines, everything.”\nThe explosions had jolted him awake, and he fled his apartment on the 12th floor down the main stairs. A fire was already burning on the first floor and he climbed through the blasted entrance hall and into the bomb crater where people grabbed his arms and pulled him out.\nClutching a plastic bag of groceries someone had given him, he waved off a question as to where he would stay the night.\n“God knows,” he said.\nthat the three traveling prime ministers had arrived “on behalf of” the European Union Council. However, E.U. officials said the men had not received the European Union’s blessing for their trip.\n \nThe visit by the three leaders created some unusual friction within the European Union, whose 27 member states have projected a united front against Moscow, taking extraordinary measures to punish it for the attack on Ukraine with record speed.\nPrime Minister Morawiecki of Poland brought up his intention to visit Kyiv at an E.U. meeting last week at Versailles, outside Paris. But the visit to Kyiv never got a formal blessing from the bloc.\nStill, the visit to Kyiv, which some E.U. officials worried might lead to promises that could not be kept, was welcomed as brave in parts of the bloc.\n“This is Europe at its best,” declared a headline in the popular German tabloid Bild, on an article that said: “Putin’s war is not over as long as Europe is ready to defend its values. With all the means it takes to do so. Even if it’s just a train ride in the shadow of bombs and missiles.”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/world/europe/mariupol-death-toll-ukraine.html",
      "text": "LVIV, Ukraine — With some residents crushed in the rubble from a relentless two-week onslaught by Russian forces, and others dying in freezing conditions with no heat, food or clean water, officials in the besieged coastal city of Mariupol are struggling to account for the number of dead and missing. \nOfficially, 2,400 civilians killed in the city have been identified, but Pyotr Andryushchenko, an adviser to the city government, said he believed the toll was far higher. \n“We have inaccurate data on civilians killed,” he said in an interview with Current Time, a Ukrainian radio station. He said the official figure represented a “small handful” of those killed and estimated that the actual total could be as high as 20,000. \nIn a telephone interview with The New York Times later, Mr. Andryushchenko said that 2,000 vehicles had managed to escape the city on Tuesday and that another 2,000 were packed and ready to leave. Officials told civilians hoping to leave to “delete all messengers and photos from phones” in case Russian soldiers tried to search them for signs of support for Ukrainian forces. \nA battleground since the first hours of the war, Mariupol is under an increasingly relentless assault that is taking an unspeakable toll. Ukrainian estimates for the number of civilians trapped in the city have ranged from 200,000 to 400,000, with the latest estimate being 300,000. \nThe region’s top official, Pavlo Kyrylenko, who until martial law was declared was its governor, announced that the Russians were also holding doctors and patients of the main intensive care hospital hostage. An estimated 400 people are inside. \n“It is impossible to get out of the hospital,” Mr. Kyrylenko wrote on Telegram, quoting a message from one of the facility’s employees. “They shoot hard, we sit in the basement. Cars have not been able to drive to the hospital for two days. High-rise buildings are burning around.”\nBattered by Russian shelling, the city has been overwhelmed by the wounded and dead. Videos shared on Telegram showed residents of the Cheryomushki neighborhood burying a body in a courtyard. Another video showed how local people had turned a post office building into a makeshift morgue, with “MORGUE” spray-painted in large Cyrillic letters on the outside of the ground floor of the building. \n“Here, in this building of the New Post Office on Cheryomushki, they stack corpses, which in the future they themselves will bury,” a man can be heard saying in the video, which he posted to the Telegram channel Mariupol Now.\nRussian forces have dropped more than 100 bombs within the city limits, according to a Telegram post by the Mariupol city council, destroying nearly all basic services, even as they battle Ukrainian forces on the outskirts of the metropolis. \nThe Kremlin has said that it is Ukrainian forces that are keeping people trapped in the city. The Ukrainian government says that repeated attempts at mass evacuation have failed as they came under attack by Russian forces. \nThere is no completely safe route in or out of the city. The roads are studded with land mines, according to international observers, and the fighting rarely subsides. \nThe Ukrainian Army’s high command said on Tuesday that its forces had managed to repel the latest Russian attempt to move into the city, claiming to have destroyed two tanks, seven infantry fighting vehicles and one armored personnel carrier. “After the losses, the occupiers stopped the offensive and retreated,” the Ukrainian military said. \nThe Ukrainians noted that their forces had also suffered losses. It is impossible to independently verify almost any information out of Mariupol, as nearly all lines of communication have been severed. \nMr. Andryushchenko, the adviser to the city government, declined to comment in his phone interview with The Times on whether he and the mayor would be evacuating from the city. The mayor’s security would likely be of concern: Russian forces kidnapped the mayor of nearby Melitopol and installed a replacement. \n“We sincerely hope for the safety of our mayor and that our defenders will help ensure it,” Mr. Andryushchenko said. “We know for sure that he will not accept the Russian occupation under any circumstances, will not cooperate with the occupiers and will not recognize any occupation authority.”\nBut he was also at a loss for words thinking about the city’s future. He has estimated that 80 percent of the residential housing stock has been destroyed. “What kind of city can it be?”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/world/europe/russia-uk-sanctions.html",
      "text": "LONDON — The British government said on Tuesday that it had imposed sanctions on more than 370 individuals it described as oligarchs, political allies or propagandists for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, a major new crackdown that brings it closer in line with the European Union on an issue that has long dogged Britain.\nThe sanctions, announced by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, include a travel ban and will freeze the assets of prominent Russians in business and government, including some of the wealthiest oligarchs and most senior officials in the Kremlin.\nAmong those on the latest list: Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president of Russia; Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin; Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin press secretary; Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia’s foreign ministry; Sergei Shoigu, the defense minister; and Mikhail Fridman, the billionaire founder of Alfa Bank, one of Russia’s largest private banks.\n“We are going further and faster than ever in hitting those closest to Putin — from major oligarchs to his prime minister and the propagandists who peddle his lies and disinformation,” Ms. Truss said in a statement. “We are holding them to account for their complicity in Russia’s crimes in Ukraine.”\nLast week, Britain imposed sanctions on Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of the Chelsea soccer club in London. But the government has faced criticism for moving slowly against other wealthy Russians, many of whom own property in London or have insinuated themselves into British politics and society.\nThe oligarchs targeted on Tuesday have an estimated combined net wealth of more than $130 billion. Some, like Mr. Fridman, own baronial residences in London. On Monday, eight protesters were arrested after occupying the balcony of a London mansion linked to another oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, who was targeted by sanctions last week along with Mr. Abramovich.\nThe latest batch of sanctions were imposed under a new Economic Crime Act, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government introduced in an effort to try, belatedly, to stem the flow of corrupt money into Britain from oligarchs and other wealthy foreigners. The act enables Britain to automatically impose the penalties on people who are under European Union sanctions.\nThe government said it had developed its own sanctions cases against four major oligarchs: Mr. Fridman and two of his partners, Petr Aven and German Khan; as well as Oleg Matveychev, a member of Russia’s Parliament, whom British officials describe as a propagandist for Mr. Putin.",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/world/middleeast/syria-ukraine-invasion-russia.html",
      "text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Syrian police stormed her house and dragged her husband away. Her eldest son died in a rain of Syrian government shells on her hometown. So like millions of other Syrians, Hanadi Hafisi fled the country with plans to return when the war ended.\nA decade later, she’s still a refugee in Turkey, where her work at a center that treats war injuries exposes her to a constant display of the human destruction wrought by President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and his Russian backers: paralysis, missing hands and legs, and deep trauma that leaves her patients asking why such disasters consumed their lives.\n“I don’t know what to tell them when they ask me whether they will reach justice,” said Ms. Hafisi, 46. “Seriously, what to tell them? That Bashar will be held accountable? That he will face trial? Of course not.”\nAs the world takes in the grim realities of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — the once-vibrant neighborhoods bombed out, the civilians killed by shells while trying to flee, the speculation about whether Russia will use chemical weapons — many Syrians have watched with a horrifying sense of déjà vu and a deep foreboding about what lies ahead.\nThe Syrian war began 11 years ago this month with an anti-Assad uprising that spiraled into a multisided conflict among the government, armed rebels, jihadists and others. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, millions have fled their homes, and Mr. al-Assad has remained in power, in large part because of the extensive support he received from the man now driving the invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.\nThe legacy of Syria’s war, and Russia’s role in it, looms large over Ukraine, offering potential lessons to Mr. Putin, analysts said: that “red lines” laid down by the West can be crossed without long-term consequences; that diplomacy purportedly aimed at stopping violence can be used to distract from it; and that autocrats can do terrible things and face international sanctions — and still stay in power.\nMuch of the brutality Mr. al-Assad deployed to quash his foes was documented in real time and spurred outrage that left many thinking he could never get away with it.\nHe dispatched soldiers and armed thugs to stop protests by locking up activists and firing live ammunition into crowds. As the opposition took up arms, his troops shelled, bombed and imposed starvation sieges on towns and neighborhoods that supported the rebels.\nThose actions killed large numbers of civilians and sent many more fleeing for their lives. More than half of Syria’s prewar population was displaced during the war, and 5.7 million refugees remain outside the country.\nIn August 2013, Mr. al-Assad’s forces shocked the world by deploying chemical weapons on rebel-held towns near the capital, Damascus, killing more than 1,400 people, U.S. officials said.\nMany Syrians expected that such a blatant violation of international law would prompt Western military intervention, especially since President Barack Obama had called the use of chemical weapons a “red line.”\n“I was sure we had witnessed something very few people had experienced before, like those who witnessed Chernobyl or Hiroshima,” recalled Ibrahim Alfawal, 29, who survived the chemical attack and said it had felt like “judgment day.”\nBut he was shocked when the United States did not intervene. Mr. al-Assad’s forces eventually took control of the towns that had been gassed, seeming to pay no price for his use of forbidden arms.\nThat seemed to show that Mr. al-Assad could count on impunity, Mr. Alfawal said, and attacks by Syrian forces on civilian infrastructure — including schools, hospitals, neighborhoods and bakeries where families had lined up to buy bread — only escalated.\nIn 2015, Mr. Putin sent Russian forces to help Mr. al-Assad’s beleaguered army, and soon Russian officers were advising Syrian forces and Russian jets were dropping bombs on Syrian cities — enjoying the same impunity that Mr. al-Assad seemed to have.\nIn Ukraine, Russia has used disinformation campaigns similar to those it pioneered in Syria, where it falsely branded opposition activists as members of Al Qaeda and accused the rebels of launching the chemical attacks as “false flag” operations to blame the Syrian government.\n“They are taking the same concept they used in Syria, to lie and to stick to it,” Mr. Alfawal said of Russia’s approach to Ukraine.\nThe chemical attacks in Syria continued. In addition to two that killed large numbers of people — in the village of Khan Sheikhoun in 2017 and east of Damascus in 2018 — there have been at least 350 other attacks with chemical substances, according to Tobias Schneider, a researcher at the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin.\nMost of those used chlorine, which is not classified as a chemical weapon but can be used as such to terrify civilians and encourage them to flee.\nWhile no evidence has surfaced that Russian forces used chemical weapons in Syria, researchers believe that Mr. Putin enabled Mr. al-Assad to do so.\n“It is absolutely certain that the Russian government at least knows and likely facilitated the use of chemical weapons by the Syrians, mostly chlorine attacks,” Mr. Schneider said.\nThere are no indications that chemical weapons have been used in Ukraine, but watching the war there, many Syrians see signs that Mr. Putin is employing parts of the Syria playbook.\nThe Russians “are willing to devour the green and the dry,” said Radwan Alhomsy, a Syrian activist in southern Turkey, using an Arabic idiom meaning to destroy everything. “They don’t care about the international community or anything else. We saw that in Syria. Burning schools is not new to us. It’s land they want to take, and they will take it.”\nEuropean analysts point out the differences between the wars in Syria and Ukraine that could lead to different Western responses. Unlike Mr. Putin, Mr. al-Assad fought to regain control of his own country, not take over one of his neighbors. Unlike Syria, Russia is a nuclear-armed power, complicating the issue of military intervention.\nAnd while the United States and its European allies largely let Mr. al-Assad get away with using chemical weapons in the Middle East, Mr. Putin’s doing so on the European continent would most likely cause greater alarm and elicit a stiffer response.\n“If Putin thinks that he’ll be treated like al-Assad, he is wrong because he is not al-Assad and this is not Syria,” said Patricia Lewis, director of the international security program at Chatham House.\nStill, Mr. Putin could take some solace from Mr. al-Assad’s survival: how the West went on mistakenly believing that Mr. al-Assad’s fall was unavoidable, and how he has clung to power despite sanctions that have strangled his economy and impoverished his people.\nEmile Hokayem, a Middle East analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, warned of two strategies used in Syria that the Russians could employ in Ukraine.\nOne was Russia’s engagement in international diplomacy aimed at ending the violence as a way of distracting the West from the war on the ground. Another was the deliberate creation of a refugee crisis to bog down Europe and sap its resources.\n“Creating a humanitarian catastrophe is part of the war strategy, not a secondary effect, because this is how you shift the burden on to the other side,” he said.\nMany Syrian refugees are watching the Ukraine war from impoverished camps across the Middle East or from European cities where they are struggling to start new lives.\nWhile some feel bitter about the warmth shown to fleeing Ukrainians, the Syrians also recall their own war, and hope the Ukrainians will fare better than they did.\n“We were left alone to face our destiny,” said Mansour Abu al-Kheir, who survived two chemical attacks east of Damascus before fleeing as a refugee to southern Turkey. “I hope this won’t happen to the Ukrainians.”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/world/europe/china-blogger-odessa-ukraine-war.html",
      "text": "In the southern Ukrainian port city of Odessa, Wang Jixian often starts his days by recording the sirens howling warnings to residents against Russian air attacks. It’s part of his own battle against the skewed, euphemistic depiction of the war propagated by Moscow’s crucial partner, China.\nMr. Wang, a Chinese computer programmer who moved to Odessa for work last year, has become one of the boldest voices challenging the Chinese state-controlled media’s version of the war, drawing hundreds of thousands of viewers. Chinese television has glossed over the bloodshed caused by Russian forces and pointedly avoided calling President Vladimir V. Putin’s actions an invasion.\nIn video dispatches from his apartment or the streets, Mr. Wang has shifted between bleak and wryly matter-of-fact when describing life in wartime.\n“That fearless neighbor is out walking his dog again,” he says in one. But he exudes fury when discussing Chinese nationalists who see Mr. Putin as a hero, justified in attacking Ukraine.\n“Since last night, the air raid alarms have sounded at least three times, and the church bells rang out more than that,” he said near the start of one recent broadcast. He then turned his camera on himself.\n“Why are you afraid of people finding out the truth?” he said. “Why can only those voices cheering on this bloody path be spread?” he continued. “Some people tell me that nowadays it’s a society where the strong devour the weak, where power comes from the barrel of a gun. Who said that? Where is the sense in that?”\nIn a phone interview, Mr. Wang, 36, said that he had been inundated with messages from Chinese viewers.\nHe puts his videos on YouTube, which people in China can view only with software to burrow past censorship, as well as on WeChat, a popular Chinese social media service, although censors have restricted his most impassioned pieces there. His WeChat video channel has attracted more than 94,000 subscribers.\nSome viewers express thanks for puncturing the propaganda. But plenty of messages come from fervent Chinese nationalists calling him a traitor or, as Mr. Wang put it, “words that can’t be quoted by newspapers.”\nStill, Mr. Wang said, some people appear to have been swayed by his work.\n“At the start, it felt like everyone was supporting the Russians,” he said. “But now I feel like I’ve used my little bit of influence to awaken at least some Chinese people and get them thinking for themselves.”\nHe said he had no intention of leaving Odessa unless survival became impossible. If it came to that, he said, “I’ll move — to another city in Ukraine.”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/world/europe/biden-nato-eu-summit-europe.html",
      "text": "President Biden will travel to an extraordinary NATO summit meeting in Brussels on March 24 and will also attend the European Union’s summit meeting the same day, White House and European officials said on Tuesday.\nThe high-stakes gathering is to discuss ongoing deterrence and defense efforts in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir V. Putin has intensified the bombardment of civilian targets as his unprovoked invasion of the country entered its third week.\n“His goal is to meet face to face with his European counterparts and talk about where we are at this point in the conflict, in the invasion of Ukraine by Russia,’’ the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said at a briefing on Tuesday afternoon. “We’ve been incredibly aligned to date. That doesn’t happen by accident.”\nThe trip comes as Mr. Biden, who helped to coordinate a rapid Western response to the invasion centered on powerful sanctions and increased military aid, faces intense pressure to take more direct action to stop the killing of Ukrainian civilians. Cease-fire talks between the combatants have so far yielded no results.\nMs. Psaki provided few details of Mr. Biden’s trip and declined to say if he planned to meet with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, whom he has praised as a hero. She also would not say whether Mr. Biden or other U.S. officials would meet with refugees who have fled the fighting.\n“We’re still finalizing the trip at this time,” said Ms. Psaki, adding, “Nothing on the table at this point in time, but the real focus right now is to meet with NATO partners in Brussels.”\nLast week, Vice President Kamala Harris visited Poland and Romania, NATO allies along Ukraine’s western borders, to express support for Ukraine and suggest that Moscow might need to be held accountable for possible war crimes in the conflict. Mr. Zelensky is expected to request greater economic and military aid when he delivers a virtual address to Congress on Wednesday.\nMr. Biden will join 30 NATO leaders at the special, hastily organized meeting, then will go to a previously scheduled European Council summit. Twenty-one of the European Union’s 27 members belong to NATO, and it is possible that close NATO allies like Sweden and Finland will also attend the meeting.\nAdministration officials said that the White House was exploring whether Mr. Biden might continue his trip to Eastern Europe, to meet some of the refugees flowing out of the country.\nMr. Biden also plans to announce more support for Ukraine’s defense, Ms. Psaki said.\n“We are on Day 19,” Ms. Psaki noted of the Russian invasion. \n“In addition to their incredible courage and bravery,’’ she said of the Ukrainians, “one of the reasons that they are able to hold back and push back against the Russian military is because of the significant amount of military assistance we have provided.”\nMr. Biden, officials say, wants to use the trip to make the case that he is succeeding at unifying NATO and other European allies. But European diplomats are concerned that there are no major decisions on the table and they are working to come up with an announcement that could arise from the extraordinary meeting of the Western alliance.\n“Mr. Biden’s goal is to meet face to face with his European counterparts and talk about where we are at this point in the conflict, in the invasion of Ukraine by Russia,” Ms. Psaki said.\nMs. Psaki shrugged off Russia’s announcement on Tuesday that it would impose reciprocal sanctions on top U.S. officials, including herself and President Biden. She suggested, jokingly, that the Kremlin’s announcement might have missed its intended mark. The president, Ms. Psaki said, is a “junior, so they might have sanctioned his dad by mistake.”",

      "text": "MYKOLAIV, Ukraine — Alla Ryabko stood in the courtyard of the city morgue, trembling with grief and rage. Her son, Capt. Roman Ryabko, had been killed in fighting on the first day of the war in Ukraine, but two weeks had passed and his body had not yet been prepared for burial.\n“He’s there lying in a bag,” she said, gesturing to the covered bodies on the ground. “They’re not even giving him to me so that I can wash him. I have to take him away in a bag, a garbage bag.”\nThe morgue is overflowing. Bodies are being released to families in the state they arrived, half-dressed in shredded military uniforms, spackled with blood and blackened by fire. Bodies are in the corridor, in the administrative offices, in the courtyard, in a storage shed nearby. They are soldiers and civilians, wrapped in sheets or carpets or nothing at all.\nEven as Ms. Ryabko cried out her anguish, artillery strikes shook the ground beneath her feet. There were already 132 bodies in the morgue that day. More would be on the way.\nThere is shelling every day in Mykolaiv. It usually starts before dawn, as a rumble or a thud or a thwack. It electrifies the air and sends a jolt through the gut, and those who choose to stay in bed, rather than flee to a basement, can shut their eyes and let their ears paint a picture of the battle raging in the dark.\nRussian forces want to take Mykolaiv because it stands in their way. The Varvarivsky Bridge in the city is the only passage for miles across the wide mouth of the Southern Buh River. By seizing the bridge, Russian fighters can push along the Black Sea coast west to Odessa, the headquarters of the Ukrainian Navy and the country’s largest civilian port.\nTo get to the bridge, they have to go through the Ukrainian fighters who, so far, have not budged. And so the Russian troops bomb, randomly and indiscriminately, striking neighborhoods, hospitals and supermarkets, opting for terror in the absence of military gain. At least a dozen civilians were killed by airstrikes over the weekend, according to the local authorities.\nYet there is also a refusal to succumb. Trash is still being collected, and city workers have embarked on an aggressive tree-pruning campaign, though the shelling is knocking down some of those trees.\nThere is the family who closed down a high-end interior design business and now drives around the city all day delivering food to needy residents, pausing only on occasion to dash into a basement for cover. There is the group of local guys who banded together to try to fix a Russian tank damaged in the fighting so that Ukraine’s military might use it.\nA few blocks from the morgue, the Coffee Go cafe is doing a brisk business, even as artillery fire rattles the plate-glass windows. When the owners tried to close down, their teenage employees rebelled, said Viktoria Kuplevskaya, an 18-year-old barista with a streak of orange in her hair.\n“We wanted to work,” she said. “I’m not scared of anything.”\nOnce a center of shipbuilding for the Russian Empire, Mykolaiv was among the first places attacked after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia gave the order to invade on Feb. 24. The Russian troops have pressed deep into the city limits, only to be pushed out, leaving behind the burned-out carcasses of armored vehicles.\nNo one knows how long Ukrainian defenders can hold. Russian forces have attacked with tanks, artillery and fighter jets, pummeling the city on three sides. Every day brings more death. But also defiance.\n“Good morning. We’re from Ukraine.”\nSo begins the typical morning video message from Vitaliy Kim, the regional governor. The joke among city residents is that nobody will leave their homes unless Mr. Kim says it is safe, and no one can sleep soundly until Mr. Kim wishes them good night. It is only a slight exaggeration. His upbeat videos on Facebook and Telegram, which he invariably opens by flashing a peace sign and toothy smile, typically garner half a million views, roughly equal to the city’s population.\n“When he smiles, we can go to bed,” said Natalya Stanislavchuk, who has been volunteering to deliver food to the needy. “If Kim says we can sleep calmly, then we can sleep calmly.”\nMr. Kim posts videos throughout the day, a mix of reassurance and withering denigration of Russian forces, whom he refers to alternatively as idiots, bastards and orcs, the evil snaggletoothed army of the east in Tolkien’s “The Lord of the Rings.” The messages are meant to bolster the spirits of city residents, even if the booms they are hearing sound terrifyingly close.\n“What can I say, the 17th day of war, all is well, the mood is excellent,” Mr. Kim said in a message over the weekend that began with news of an airstrike on a residential neighborhood. “We have freedom and we’re fighting for it. And all they have is slavery. We want all of our dreams to come true and we’re moving in that direction. Together to victory.”\nA month ago, Mr. Kim’s main priorities centered around improving roads and the region’s tourism infrastructure, including big plans to develop a resort on a picturesque piece of the Black Sea coast.\n“These were costly, large, beautiful projects that were needed, and in one day this was destroyed,” Mr. Kim said.\nNow he coordinates with the military for the defense of the city. Meeting for an interview at the regional administration headquarters, Mr. Kim was dressed in green cargo pants with a black pistol holstered to his belt.\nHe predicted that any Russian effort to take Mykolaiv would lead to a bloody and destructive street-by-street firefight. Every street corner has a pile of tires and a ready incendiary bomb sitting next to it. Should Russian forces enter the city, residents are prepared to quickly plunge them into a smoky blackness, giving cover as the Ukrainian defenders attempt to pick off the Russian tanks one by one.\nIt would be apocalyptic, Mr. Kim said.\n“My strategy is to be much more joyous than is appropriate for this kind of situation,” he said. “This doesn’t mean that I don’t understand how serious things are.”\nThe fireball lit up the night sky like an early sunrise. Another day of Russian shelling had begun.\nIt was Monday, March 7, and Russian forces had launched an early-morning attack that jolted residents from their beds. They fled into makeshift bomb shelters, basements that many residents have outfitted with mattresses and shipping pallets for sleeping because they now spend so much time there.\n“They attacked our city dishonorably, cynically, while people were sleeping,” Mr. Kim said in one of his messages.\nA cruise missile had hit a barracks filled with sleeping soldiers from the 79th Ukrainian Air Assault Brigade. Eight were killed and another eight were missing, their bodies buried in the pile of rubble. The strike opened the barracks like a dollhouse, revealing an eerie glimpse into a soldier’s daily life: gray steel bunk beds, regulations posted on the wall.\nIt could have been worse had the missile not first slammed into a line of poplar trees, sending it slightly off target.\n“We were very lucky that these poplar trees were here because if it were a direct strike we would have all been screwed,” said a soldier named Vova, who was helping to search for bodies. “The poplars bent the rocket’s trajectory.”\nIt was the same across Mykolaiv that day. In one neighborhood of densely packed apartment blocks, residents alternated between clearing out their shattered homes and dashing to basement bomb shelters amid continuing strikes. One woman, when approached by a reporter, unleashed such a torrent of profanity directed at Mr. Putin that she felt the need to apologize, and then burst into tears.\nThe missile strikes had blown out windows and sprayed shrapnel through furniture, walls and appliances.\n“Look at how the Russian world is saving us,” Marina Babenko, a mother of two, said, referring sarcastically to Mr. Putin’s claim that Russia was waging a war of liberation. “We were living fine and had everything we needed. Now they’re bombing residential neighborhoods, women and children. We have no weapons. All we can do is hide in the basement. We have no strength for anything else.”\nIn the tidy neighborhood of Balabanivka, residents were cleaning up after Russian jets dropped a payload of bombs early in the morning that leveled homes and killed several residents.\nA bomb had carved a large crater out of what used to be Roman Nikora’s backyard, and three chickens sat beside the mangled remains of their hut. An acrid smell hung in the air.\n“Come, let me show you how we survived,” Mr. Nikora said, leading a visitor into the shallow basement where he had hidden during the bombing with his wife, their child and his parents.\nThe basement looked like it had been turned upside down and shaken. Cabinets had been ripped off the wall; part of the backyard was pushed through the windows.\n“They’re worse than the fascists,” Mr. Nikora, 32, a businessman, said of the Russian forces. “They’re saying they only target military objects, military structures. Well, there’s nothing like that here.”\nDespite his fear of more bombing, Mr. Nikora said that he and his family had no plans to go anywhere.\n“We’ll rebuild,” he said. “I still have hands.”\nTwo older women were sitting on a bench in a city park, watching three young children play, when their conversation was interrupted by an ominous droning sound. An air raid siren. The women kept talking. After a few minutes, they slowly rose, bundled the youngest child into a stroller, and walked away in no great hurry.\nRussian rocket attacks may now set the rhythm of life in Mykolaiv, but many residents are determined to play the song in a key of their own choosing.\n“There is no panic,” said Ms. Stanislavchuk, who spoke so admiringly of Mr. Kim, the governor. “Our people coolly evaluate the situation and help one another.”\nBefore the war, Ms. Stanislavchuk and her husband, Aleksandr, had planned to open a second branch of their interior design business in Bucha, an up-and-coming suburb of Kyiv where their son, Yegor, had moved into a sleek, newly built development.\nLast week, they were instead driving around Mykolaiv, their hometown, passing out food and nervously awaiting news from Yegor. He was attempting to escape Bucha with his pet rabbit, Diva, after hiding in a basement for several days from the Russian troops who had occupied the suburb.\n“There are those moments when morale falters and when your mood sours,” said Ms. Stanislavchuk, who was carrying an Orthodox icon of the Virgin Mary. “But when you see that someone needs your help and support, you have to get up and move. Then you realize that it will come to an end because the truth is on our side.”\nThere has been an exodus from Mykolaiv during the past two weeks. On some mornings, large convoys of cars and buses, some with homemade cardboard signs saying, “Children,” have snarled traffic at the Varvarivsky Bridge.\nThe bridge is the escape route. It is also a prize that Russian forces covet.\nBut should they enter the city, in addition to Ukrainian military forces, the Russian troops will have to face people like Dmitry Dmitriev, a local journalist who has put down his pen in favor of a submachine gun. On a recent visit to the offices of his online news outlet, there were more guns than journalists, and boxes of ammunition littered the floor.\n“All of us are participating in the resistance,” Mr. Dmitriev said.\nThe Russian forces will also have to contend with Nikolai Bilyashchat, a 54-year-old bus driver. Last week, Mr. Bilyashchat was with neighbors, cigarettes dangling from their lips, peering into the open engine bay of a Russian T-90 tank.\nA day earlier, Ukrainian forces had blown up a bridge as the tank was crossing over. It was still functional but could only drive in circles. A white Z, which has been used by the Russian forces to identify their vehicles, had been painted over in green, and the tank’s antenna mast sported a Ukrainian flag.\nMr. Bilyashchat wanted to get it running and turn it against the Russian troops.\n“We’re just locals. I’m not a mechanic. I’m just helping,” he said. “What else are we supposed to do? We need to help somehow. I’m not going to sit at home and hide.”\nAt City Hospital No. 3, Anna Smetana sat up in a cot, sobbing. A 40-year-old mother, she was wearing a peach dress with black polka dots, her shoulder and leg covered by large bandages soaked through with blood.\nTwo days earlier, Ms. Smetana and six of her colleagues from a local orphanage were driving to a small village where the children had been evacuated at the start of the war. About 15 miles outside of the city, she said, an armored Russian fighting vehicle, emblazoned with a white Z, opened fire on the van.\n“First they shot at us with automatic weapons,” Ms. Smetana said. “Then the car caught on fire and filled with smoke.”\n“Get out, get out,” she said the soldiers had told her. “They put us on our knees, pointed their weapons at us and took our telephones.”\n“We asked them to give them back,” she said. Their reply: “No, not possible. We have orders.”\nThree of Ms. Smetana’s colleagues were incinerated by the fire that engulfed the van, she said. Ms. Smetana was shot twice in the shoulder and once in the leg.\n“There were rockets everywhere, bombs,” she added. “All we heard were the sounds of explosions.”\nOn just one day, Ms. Smetana was one of 25 patients being treated for wounds from shelling and gunfire, according to the hospital’s medical director, Dmitri Kolosov. Earlier in the week, shells had landed in the hospital courtyard, spraying shrapnel in all directions, he added.\n“We thought coronavirus was a nightmare,” Mr. Kolosov said. “But this is hell.”\nBlack strafe marks pock a prop plane that sits on the runway of Mykolaiv’s small international airport. Inside, the security screening area has been gutted, and in a second-floor lounge are the remains of a soldier’s dinner of canned sardines in tomato sauce.\nEarly in the war, Russian troops held the airport briefly, only to be quickly expelled by Ukrainian fighters. Since then, the Russian forces have kept trying to gain control so that their transport planes can bring in troops and equipment to feed their fight and continue their push west.\nBut, for now, the Ukrainians keep stopping them. Video taken by Ukrainian troops show them firing shoulder-mounted rockets from the roof of the airport at Russian fighters below.\nOn a recent visit, the Ukrainian flag was flying.\n“We have a very strong position and we’re waiting for them,” said Sgt. Ruslan Khoda, who insisted on practicing his English with a reporter. “There is nothing unexpected. We know they are arriving and from where they’re arriving. And we’re ready to say, ‘Hello, Russian stupid boys.’”\nSergeant Khoda said that Russian forces appeared to be probing for weakness. They launch attacks from the north and northeast, then switch directions and come from the south. Often, he said, attacks are preceded by overflights of Russian surveillance drones.\n“They are trying to attack us from different sides to taste our protection, to taste our power,” he said. “Russian troops did not expect such a strong army.”\nMaj. Gen. Dmitry Marchenko, commander of Ukraine’s military forces in Mykolaiv, said that the Ukrainian strategy was to break morale through an unrelenting pounding of Russian positions. But there is another critical factor.\n“We are defending our homes, our women, our families,” he said. “We don’t need their world. We don’t need their language. Let them build their own country and die in it and create whatever dictatorship they want there. We’re going to live like free people.”\nOn Monday, Mr. Kim was somber in his evening video message. He acknowledged that the situation had grown more serious, while denigrating the Russian troops as “idiots” for attacking civilian areas with rockets.\n“There’s no logical sense to it,” he said. “But the initiative is on our side, and we’re moving.”\nWith that, on the 18th day of the war, he sent the people of Mykolaiv to bed.\n“I wish everyone a boring night.”",

      "headline": "Indian Court Upholds Ban on Hijabs in Schools",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/15/world/asia/india-hijab-ban-schools.html",
      "text": "A top court in the southern Indian state of Karnataka on Tuesday upheld a government order banning Muslim girls from wearing head scarves inside schools, a ruling that is likely to heighten tensions at a time when India is increasingly polarized along religious lines. \nThe court said that wearing the hijab is not part of essential religious practice under Islam. The ruling came at a time when members of India’s minority community are increasingly coming under attack as the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has adopted Hindu-first policies.\nReligious freedom is protected under the country’s Constitution, but there has been a proliferation of religious-based hate crimes, particularly against members of the Muslim community. Their members and right-wing Hindu activists have also been clashing at school campuses around Karnataka.\nThe dispute began in September at a college preparatory school for girls in Udupi, a city in southwestern Karnataka, when teachers there barred several Muslim students from entering their classrooms while wearing hijabs.\nIn previous years, head scarves had not been a problem, according to one of the petitioners who sought to overturn the ban. The school’s ban, later affirmed by the state government, set off unrest and violence that spread to other schools in the state, prompting the government to close down schools for days.\nWhen the students defied the ban, they were met at the campus by scores of boys wearing saffron, the color most associated with Hinduism, and shouting slogans like “Hail Lord Ram,” a major Hindu god.\nSeveral of the students’ parents filed a petition, which the judges considered before their ruling. The three judges heard arguments from lawyers to overturn the hijab ban, while students’ lawyers argued that it violated the girls’ right to an education and their freedom of religion. India’s Constitution affirms “the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion.”\nThe court previously issued an intermediate order preventing students from wearing any religious garb, including saffron shawls, until the decision on Tuesday.\nPralhad Joshi, a federal minister of parliamentary affairs, welcomed the court’s decision, which is likely to affect thousands of hijab-wearing students in Karnataka, saying that the “basic work of the students is to study.”\nMr. Joshi also told the Indian news agency ANI, “Everyone has to maintain peace by accepting the order of the high court.”\nIn recent weeks, the restrictions on students wearing head scarves had become a flash point over minority rights in India. Critics of Mr. Modi say his Bharatiya Janata Party is increasingly taking steps to marginalize the country’s 200 million Muslims, one of the largest Muslim populations in the world.\nRight-wing Hindu monks have made calls for other Hindus to arm themselves and kill Muslims. And there has been a rise in violence against Muslims in India under Mr. Modi, part of a broader shift in which minorities feel less safe.\nRecently, a prominent Muslim member of Parliament survived an apparent assassination attempt while campaigning in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. After the police arrested two people accused of shooting at the lawmaker’s vehicle, members of Mr. Modi’s party visited the home of a suspect and declared him innocent.\nKarnataka, where the hijab controversy is playing out, is controlled by Mr. Modi’s party. The students’ protest there has inspired Muslim women to march elsewhere in India for their right to wear head scarves and other Islamic clothing.\n“The hijab is not a moment where liberty or equality are being tested,” wrote Pratap Bhanu Mehta, a columnist for The Indian Express. “It is coming when there is an attempt to visibly erase Muslims from India’s public culture.”\nKarnataka residents said some Muslim women wearing head scarves have been prevented from entering shops or have been chided on public transportation. In another state, a hijab-wearing woman was not allowed to withdraw cash from a bank, Indian news media reported.\n“When you board a bus, everyone starts staring at you,” said Huzaifa Kulsum, a homemaker in Karnataka who said she had worn the hijab since childhood. “It seems suddenly everyone is interested in knowing why we wear it.”\nVideo footage at some schools in Karnataka showed Muslim students and teachers being directed to remove head coverings before entering the campus. Many parents instead chose not to have their children attend the school.\nOn Tuesday, the authorities in Karnataka closed schools and colleges for a day and police officers were seen patrolling the streets. Before the court ruling, the regional government banned large gatherings for a week in Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka state, in order “to maintain public peace and order.”\nThe girls who had petitioned the court have decided that they will appeal the ban to India’s top court, according to their lawyer, Anas Tanwir.\nAiman Mohiuddin, a student who was among those barred from wearing the hijab at Rotary School in Mandya, a city in Karnataka, said before the verdict that she had felt as if someone was chopping off part of her body.\nDuring the hearings, a top government lawyer told the judges that barring students from wearing the hijab at school did not violate guarantees of religious freedom under the Indian Constitution.\nPrabhuling Navadgi, a lawyer representing the Karnataka government, told the court that educational institutions had the right to set school dress rules.\n“There is no issue of hijab in the government order,” he said. “The government order is innocuous in nature. It does not affect the petitioners’ rights.”",

The leaders of the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovenia were traveling by train and crossed into Ukraine on Tuesday morning, officials said.\nAs evidence grows that Russia’s advance has stalled across multiple fronts, talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators were set to resume on Tuesday, presenting a narrow path to a diplomatic solution.\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine sought to step up pressure on the Kremlin by reiterating appeals to Russian soldiers and citizens appalled by the war to end the fighting. “As long as your country has not completely closed itself off from the whole world, turning into a very large North Korea, you must fight,” he said in a video address in Russian.\nThere was little sign that the Kremlin would ease its assault, however, as it relies on long-range missiles and heavy artillery to bombard cities and other targets across Ukraine.\nHere are some of the latest developments:",

      "text": "President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine called on Russian troops to surrender in a video address posted online early Tuesday.\n“On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I give you a chance,” he said in a translation of his address shared by his office. “If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you the way people are supposed to be treated — as people, decently.”\nIn his address, Mr. Zelensky said Russia had already lost 90 warplanes and that Russian troops “did not expect such resistance.”\n“They believed in their propaganda, which has been lying about us for decades,” he said.\nMr. Zelensky’s call for surrender was not the first time the Ukrainian government made such a proposal to Russian troops. Two weeks ago, Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, offered Russian soldiers cash and amnesty if they surrendered.\nIn an address on Saturday, Mr. Zelensky said thousands of Russian soldiers had either been captured or had surrendered. Earlier this month, the Pentagon said some Russian troops had surrendered but it did not say how many had done so.\nMr. Zelensky also said he was grateful for Russians who continued to fight Russian disinformation about the war, singling out a woman who walked in on a live broadcast of a Russian state-run news show on Monday evening, holding up a sign that said “They’re lying to you here.”\nThe woman, Marina Ovsyannikova, worked for Channel 1, the channel whose broadcast she stormed. She was later detained and was being held at a small police station, according to OVD-Info, an activist group that supports Russians detained for protesting.\n“To those who are not afraid to protest: As long as your country has not completely closed itself off from the whole world, turning into a very large North Korea, you must fight.” Mr. Zelensky said. “You must not lose your chance.”\nMr. Zelensky said that some Russian troops were fleeing battlefields and abandoning equipment.\n“Today, Russian troops are, in fact, one of the suppliers of equipment to our army,” he said.\nAddressing Russian conscripts and officers, Mr. Zelensky asked them “why should you die?”\n“What for?” Mr. Zelensky said. “I know that you want to survive. We hear your conversations in the intercepts. We hear what you really think about this senseless war, about this disgrace and about your state.”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/world/australia/new-zealand-maori-tane-mahuta-kauri.html",
      "text": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand — In an ancient grove in northern New Zealand, the mighty conifer known as Tāne Mahuta, lord of the forest, is threatened by the encroachment of a deadly enemy.\nIt is the largest kauri tree known to be living: 177 feet tall, 53 feet in circumference. Kauri, native to New Zealand, are among the world’s longest-living trees, and Tāne Mahuta has been growing in Waipoua Forest for about 2,000 years — longer than New Zealand has been inhabited by humans. It is named after the god of forests in Māori mythology, who is said to have pushed apart the sky father and the earth mother to create space for life to thrive.\nBut Tāne Mahuta stands just 200 feet from another kauri whose roots are infected with an incurable disease. Kauri dieback, caused by a microscopic, fungus-like organism, has reached pandemic proportions and driven an already threatened species closer to extinction. Nearby, five other kauri are also infected.\nGiven the age and size of kauri, many Māori view them as distant ancestors. Tāne Mahuta is particularly special to some, for the connection to the Māori creation story. “The threat of kauri dieback to the species is a threat to Māori identity itself,” said Taoho Patuawa, chief science officer for the local Māori tribe, Te Roroa.\nThat tribe and others are racing to protect the remaining kauri before it’s too late. After more than a decade of government inaction and patchy scientific research, Māori have taken a lead on conservation efforts, hoping to buy time for development of a cure.\nKauri dieback, discovered in 2006, spreads through the movement of infested soil, often via mud on shoes. Once close to a kauri, the disease’s spores infect its roots, causing them to rot. The disease can infect other plant life, but it is particularly devastating to kauri.\nWhen it reaches the trunk, lesions break out. Kauri begin to bleed yellow, pus-like gum in an attempt to cover their sides in thick armor. But it is already too late. The pathogen corrodes the internal tissues that carry nutrients and water, essentially starving the tree to death. When kauri die, so does much of the surrounding plant life that relies on it.\nInjecting phosphite can slow the progress of the disease, but there is no cure.\nIn 2017, New Zealand’s forestry minister at the time, Shane Jones, described the government’s kauri dieback response up to that point as “an unmitigated disaster.” Experts predicted that the species, which once covered millions of acres in New Zealand, would go extinct within three decades.\nMāori researchers, who are often more connected to the communities affected by kauri dieback, have disproportionately been the ones calling for action. Melanie Mark-Shadbolt, an environmental sociologist, said the government had not taken kauri dieback, or Māori concerns about it, seriously. The government’s biodiversity protection system, she said, “doesn’t provide for Māori at all.”\nNick Waipara, a scientist who specializes in kauri dieback, said that the competitive system for scientific funding had directed money toward the priorities of non-Māori researchers.\nFor a decade, he said, work on the disease was “problematic, underfunded, piecemeal and ad hoc.”\nThe lag had devastating consequences. “I’ve seen with my own eyes, when we’ve been doing long-term monitoring of plots, places where in some years we haven’t found a single seedling that was alive,” Dr. Waipara said.\nSnow Tane, the general manager of the Te Roroa Development Group, said that around 2015 the tribe began to realize that not only did kauri dieback pose an enormous threat to the forests of New Zealand, but that little help was on the way.\n“We could have waited for something to happen, or we could have started the ball rolling ourselves,” Mr. Tane said.\nSo the tribe stationed kauri ambassadors on tracks and near the forest’s entrances to explain to visitors the significance of the trees and ensure nobody strayed too close to them. The tribe had previously worked with New Zealand’s Department of Conservation to install a boardwalk near Tāne Mahuta to prevent visitors from spreading infected soil near its roots. In 2018, after camera surveillance showed dozens of people were still evading ambassadors and leaving the track to get closer to its trunk, guardrails went up too.\nThe election of a center-left government in 2017 also provided a boost. The new biodiversity minister, Damien O’Connor, pushed through stronger government policies on kauri dieback. According to Dr. Waipara and Ms. Mark-Shadbolt, this prompted the bodies that fund scientific research to take more interest in kauri solutions.\nStuart Anderson, the deputy director-general for biosecurity in the Ministry of Primary Industries, said the agency was committed to working with Māori and noted that of the 8 million New Zealand dollars ($5.3 million) it will spend on kauri dieback this year, half will go directly to Māori groups.\nEven these measures, though, seemed insufficient to fight the disease. So the Te Roroa tribe went further, exercising its authority as custodians of Waipoua Forest to close many of its walking tracks entirely. When the government imposed Covid-19 lockdowns in 2020, Te Roroa took the opportunity to impose a rāhui, or temporary prohibition on entry, over the whole forest.\nThese restrictions caused controversy. Dr. Waipara said that forest managers and scientists he knew had been violently threatened by people who oppose restrictions, or even deny the disease’s existence.\nHe compared it to the backlash against efforts to contain Covid-19. “There’s similar issues, stress, threats, denials and quite horrific behavior by some people,” he said.\nStill, monitoring done by Te Roroa indicated that the restrictions were working. According to Mr. Patuawa, Te Roroa’s chief science officer, they were only dealing with “pockets of infected trees in decline.” Te Roroa was sufficiently satisfied to lift its rāhui over Waipoua Forest later in 2020.\nMr. Patuawa cautioned that would change if kauri dieback spread closer to Tāne Mahuta and other key kauri.\n“New Zealand needs to drop the sense of entitlement that we have to be anywhere we want to be,” he said. “We need to be a little bit more sensitive to these beautiful places.”\nBut, for now, there’s hope among advocates that Māori-led interventions have created enough time for scientists to save the kauri. And even with the threat that Tāne Mahuta faces, Dr. Waipara said, “I think he is in very good hands.”",

      "headline": "Moldovans Welcome Fleeing Ukrainians, but Some Pack Their Own Bags, Too",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/world/europe/ukraine-moldova-russia-invasion.html",
      "text": "PURCARI, Moldova — Angela Dragan, a chef at a famous Moldovan winery, has spent the past two weeks making food for the exodus of refugees fleeing the invasion in neighboring Ukraine, and has hosted at least 10 of them in her home. There but for the grace of God, she reckons.\nBut grace can be fleeting, and so every day, Ms. Dragan brings her passport to work, ready to join the exodus if necessary. For now, she said, she won’t do so “for moral reasons — refugees are coming and we need to help them.” But if the Russians advance toward Moldova? “We could leave at any moment,” she said.\nAcross Moldova, a small, poor post-Soviet democracy next to Ukraine’s southwestern border, Moldovans are watching Russia’s advance on nearby Odessa — and packing their bags, just in case. The war has already profoundly affected Moldova: Per capita, it has welcomed more Ukrainian refugees than any other country, and many ordinary Moldovans have housed refugees in their apartments. Now, some Moldovans are wondering if and when they should join a westward exodus that is already Europe’s fastest-growing refugee crisis since the end of World War II. \n“I have people who ask me every day: ‘If I go, where should I go?’” said Alina Radu, the editor of Ziarul de Garda, an investigative newspaper in Moldova. “And I have people who want to see examples of people staying, because they are afraid.”\nRussia has said nothing about invading Moldova, and Belarus, its close ally, has retracted a map, shown in a briefing last week by the Belarusian president, that was marked with arrows suggesting a planned Russian advance into Moldova.\nBut the events of the last month in Ukraine, coupled with the weak state of the Moldovan military and the country’s turbulent history, have persuaded some Moldovans that anything is possible, and that it is just common sense to be considering an exit strategy.\nA Russian regiment is already stationed on Moldovan soil, in the breakaway, Russian-backed territory of Transnistria, where secessionists took control after a war in 1992. Moldova is closer to the Ukrainian front lines than any other country not itself involved in the war. And Moldova has a long history of being dominated by foreign powers, including the Ottoman Empire, the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union.\nFor many Moldovans, it is easy to imagine the invading Russian armies in Ukraine, currently just 100 miles east of Moldova, advancing westward to Transnistria — or beyond.\n“We’ve been a couple of times swallowed by the Russians,” said Elena Ivanesi, 39, who fled Moldova on the first day of the war in Ukraine with her husband and two children, fearing a new Russian invasion. Ms. Ivanesi spoke by phone from a friend’s house in western Romania; she has left her own home in the hands of a family of refugees from Ukraine.\nMoldova is “in a very weak position,” Ms. Ivanesi explained. “We don’t have the power to fight.”\nWhile the Moldovan government and foreign diplomats say there is currently no evidence of Transnistria getting dragged into the war, the mood here is fraught.\nEuropean ambassadors felt obliged Tuesday to release a video proving that they were still in Moldova, amid rumors that they had left en masse. In one isolated village in eastern Moldova, residents caused a brief run on a bank last month amid fears that the Ukraine war would prompt violence in Transnistria, potentially cutting off their supply routes.\n“On one hand, we’re witnessing unprecedented unity and mobilization of people in helping the refugees,” said Alexandru Flenchea, a political analyst and former deputy prime minister. “But on the other hand, people are scared.”\nOn a busy street in Chisinau, the Moldovan capital, Veronica Soltan, a 70-year-old teacher, pulled a brand-new suitcase along the sidewalk. If Russia invades, Ms. Soltan said, she will head immediately to Moldova’s western border with Romania, where her son has promised to collect her. Now she had a small blue suitcase to pack her things in.\n“The Russians will conquer Ukraine, and after that they’ll come to Moldova,” Ms. Soltan said. “They’ll make the map like it was in 1945,” when Moldova was part of the Soviet Union.\nSeveral people who had already packed their bags declined to be interviewed or to give their full names, worried about being seen as cowardly.\nBut to Ms. Soltan, who later packed her bag with essential clothes, medication and identity documents, her decision was simply logical. “We have to be ready,” she said. “Because you don’t know when it will happen.”\nMoldova is no stranger to emigration. Since leaving the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the country has experienced huge depopulation, as citizens headed abroad to escape a dawdling economy and rampant corruption for better opportunities elsewhere. About a quarter of Moldovans now live outside the country, according to estimates by the United Nations Development Program.\nThat in turn makes it easier for those still in Moldova to leave themselves: They have a network of friends and family to stay with abroad. About 40 percent of Moldovans also have a Romanian passport, which allows them to settle anywhere in the European Union, the bloc that Romania joined in 2007.\nSome have already made use of these avenues.\nThe week the war started, Vitalie Perciun, a Moldovan video producer based in Britain, drove 1,700 miles across Europe to pick up his two daughters from Moldova, where they live with his ex-wife.\n“We don’t know if Putin will attack Moldova, but there’s no reason to assume that he won’t,” Mr. Perciun said in a phone interview, as he drove his children back to Britain, somewhere on the road between Brussels and Calais, France. “I’ve been saying to everyone near to me: If you want to leave — leave now,” Mr. Perciun said. “Before the panic sets in.”\nGovernment records suggest that there has been only a small rise in the net number of Moldovans who have left the country since the start of the war. More than 62,000 Moldovans left between Feb. 24, the first day of the Russian invasion, and Monday, about 22,000 more than during the same period last year. But the number of Moldovans returning to Moldova has also risen, by 17,000, according to data supplied by the Moldovan interior ministry.\nMany Moldovans say they intend to stay.\nOne of them is Ms. Radu, the newspaper editor. She said she was proud of having stayed in Moldova throughout its post-Soviet history, even as many others left. She wants to sustain her newspaper, though that work would put her at risk should Russia invade.\n“There is another way,” Ms. Radu said. “To stay, to fight, and to make a better life where you are.”",

      "headline": "For this border crisis, Poles extend a warm welcome, unlike last time.",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/world/europe/ukraine-refugees-poland-russia.html",
      "text": "On the morning after Russia invaded Ukraine, Maria Hawranek did what hundreds of thousands of Poles would soon do: She signed up to host refugees at her home in Krakow.\nIn the evening, she got a call: A family from Lviv was on their way.\n“We didn’t even discuss it,” said Ms. Hawranek, a freelance journalist whose partner, also a journalist, immediately left to cover the war. “It was obvious that we were going to do this.”\nOf the 1.7 million people who have fled Ukraine since the beginning of the invasion, more than one million have made their way to Poland, according to the United Nations.\nThis huge, sudden influx of refugees has given rise to an enormous grassroots movement across Polish society, as private individuals have mobilized to raise funds and offer free accommodation and transport to the refugees.\nMore than 500,000 Poles have joined a nationwide Facebook group coordinating support. In some places, supply was greater than demand, with local authorities calling on citizens to refrain from driving to the border to offer free rides, because they were causing traffic jams.\nYears of nationalist, anti-refugee policies have left Poland with a fragmented immigration system. It’s now mostly up to citizens to handle what the U.N.H.C.R. said was “the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.”\nMs. Hawranek’s guests arrived on Friday night: Kostiantyn Komkov, a software developer, Olena Poretskova, a costume designer, and their 5-year old son, Tomas. As soon as the invasion started, the family immediately left their Lviv apartment to friends who were evacuating from Kyiv, and crossed the border to Poland. “I had anticipated an attack for the past two years, and when I saw the Russian troops building at the border, I knew this was it,” Ms Poretskova said.\nFor Tanja Fedchyk, a nurse from Luck in western Ukraine, who has also found asylum in Poland, the decision on whether to stay or go was not instantaneous. When the Russian army first entered eastern Ukraine, she and her husband decided to wait 24 hours. “We were hoping that the situation wouldn’t develop into a full-scale invasion,” Ms. Fedchyk said. “But as hours passed, it became obvious that things were only getting worse.”\nThe next morning, Ms. Fedchyk and her 2-year-old son, Tymi, got in a car and headed for Wroclaw, Poland. The trip went relatively smoothly, except for a 10-hour wait at the border. But saying goodbye to their husband and father, who stayed in Luck to build barricades, left them heartbroken. \nIn Wroclaw, they are hosted by Robert and Hana Reisigová-Kielawski, an English language university instructor and a human-resources supervisor, who live with their two children. The couple didn’t have a spare room in the apartment so they moved their 5-year-old daughter to their bedroom.\n“As we waited for their arrival, we got nervous,” Mr. Reisigová-Kielawski said. “We had no idea what physical and emotional state they would be in. I wondered how we should behave in order to be as helpful as possible, but also not overwhelm them. Which issues should we discuss and which are best left unsaid?”\nOne thing was clear from the beginning: They wouldn’t ask their guests how long they were planning to stay. Their invitation didn’t have an expiration date.\nBut whenever they asked if Ms. Fedchyk needed anything, she would say, “No, thank you. We’re just here for a few days.” As the invasion unfolded, however, it became evident that those days could turn into weeks, perhaps longer.\nSince the war began, Ukrainians on both sides of the border have faced uncertainty. In Poland, the government is preparing an emergency bill that will make it easier for Ukrainians to access the labor market and some of the social benefits available to permanent residents. \nCommentators have pointed out that the warm welcome Ukrainian refugees have received stands in stark contrast to the public response to the humanitarian crisis at the border with Belarus, which peaked in October. The government did not open the border to those refugees, most from the Middle East, and it banned aid workers from the border region — policies widely supported by Poles.\nThe Reisigová-Kielawskis, long active in various refugee-support programs, were frustrated.\n“During that crisis the government made it extremely difficult for Poles to help refugees, and unfortunately many people chose to look away,” Mr. Reisigová-Kielawski said, adding. “The grassroots movement to help Ukrainians, which we are seeing at the moment, is immense and heartwarming, but I have the impression that it is also lined with a sense of guilt that as a society we didn’t do enough back then.”",

      "headline": "Biden bans U.S. imports of Russian oil and natural gas, and Britain vows to phase Russian oil out.",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/world/europe/biden-bans-russian-oil.html",
      "text": "WASHINGTON — President Biden said Tuesday that the United States was punishing Russia for a “vicious war of choice” in Ukraine by banning importation of the country’s oil, gas and coal, but warned Americans that the decision would inevitably mean painful, higher prices for energy and at the gas pump.\n“I said I would level with the American people from the beginning,” Mr. Biden said. “And when I first spoke to this, I said defending freedom is going to cost. It’s going to cost us as well, in the United States.”\nWhite House officials said the president signed an executive order on Tuesday that prohibits anyone in the United States from importing “Russian crude oil and certain petroleum products, liquefied natural gas and coal.” It also bans new U.S. investment directly in Russia’s energy sector or in foreign companies that are investing in energy production in Russia, officials said.\nMr. Biden’s decision effectively shuts off the relatively small flow of oil into the United States, which receives less than 10 percent of its energy resources from Russia. Republicans and Democrats in Congress had been urging the president to take the step to ensure that Mr. Putin was not profiting from American purchases of oil.\nBritain on Tuesday joined the United States in taking action. In an announcement at about the same time as Mr. Biden was speaking, Britain said it would phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of the year to increase the economic isolation of Russia’s president, Vladimir. V. Putin.\nThe British decision does not affect Russian gas supplies and would give oil importers several months to make alternative plans to try to avoid any disruption.\nUnlike several other western European nations, Britain is not a big importer of Russian energy. Still, Russia accounted for 8.3 percent of Britain’s crude oil imports in 2020, according to government statistics, and prices have already been rising at gas stations while other energy costs, for industry and domestic heating, have spiked there.\nIn brief remarks before heading to Texas for an event about veterans, Mr. Biden vowed to do what he could to minimize the impact of the decision on gas prices, but he did not specify whether the United States would seek to import oil from other countries already under sanctions, like Venezuela or Iran.\nAnd he warned oil companies in the United States not to take advantage of the decision by arbitrarily raising prices.\n“Russia’s aggression is costing us all,” he said. “And it’s no time for profiteering or price gouging.”\nOfficials said Mr. Biden had struggled for days about whether the take the step amid concerns about whether it would accelerate the already rapid rise in the price of gasoline — a potent political issue for Americans in a critical election year.\nIn announcing his decision, Mr. Biden acknowledged that some European countries, including Germany and France, would most likely not follow suit because they rely much more heavily on energy from Russia.\n“A united response to Putin’s aggression has been my overriding focus to keep all of NATO and all of the E.U. and our allies totally united,” Mr. Biden said. “We’re moving forward with this ban understanding that many of our European allies and partners may not be in a position to join us.”\nAlready, concern about disruptions in the flow of oil around the world has pushed up the price of Brent crude, the global benchmark for oil. On Tuesday morning, Brent crude hit $130 a barrel. It has been as high as $139 a barrel, up 26 percent over the past week.\nIn his remarks, Mr. Biden sought to blunt the attacks from Republicans, who have already accused the administration of pursuing environmental policies — such as blocking drilling on some public lands — that have made the situation worse. Some Republicans have urged the president to allow more drilling as a way of replacing the oil that has been coming from Russia.\nMr. Biden said that oil companies in the United States already have permission to drill in areas that they have not yet tapped.\n“They have 9,000 permits to drill now,” he said. “They could be drilling right now, yesterday, last week, last year. They have 9,000 to drill onshore that are already approved. So let me be clear — let me be clear. They are not using them for production now. That’s their decision. These are the facts.”\nMany Republicans and Democrats in Congress have pushed for a ban on Russian energy. But the White House is bracing for criticism from Republicans as the price of gas and other energy rises over the coming weeks.\n“This crisis is a stark reminder: To protect our economy over the long term, we need to become energy independent,” he said, adding: “It should motivate us to accelerate the transition to clean energy.”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/world/europe/battlefield-reports-ukraine-russia.html",
      "text": "LVIV, Ukraine — With Russia and Ukraine engaged in an information war that is at times as intense as the clashes on the battlefield, attempts to capture losses and victories by either side are obscured by the fog of conflict and the work of powerful propaganda machines.\nNearly two weeks into the war, it is clear that Russia has failed to seize and control almost any major cities or population centers — including the prize targets of Kyiv, in the center of the country, and Kharkiv in the northeast. Odessa, a vital port city in the south, is bracing for an assault but the Russian land advance in that direction has been thwarted repeatedly.\nStill, the Ukrainian government is presenting a picture of Russian losses that is both staggering and hard to verify.\nSince the start of the war, Ukraine’s military claims to have killed more than 12,000 Russian soldiers. In its latest daily update on Tuesday, the military said that it had shot down or destroyed 48 Russian airplanes and 80 helicopters; captured or destroyed 303 tanks and hundreds of mechanized vehicles and cars; taken out two Russian naval vessels, including a warship; and blown up dozens of fuel tanker and mobile missile launching systems.\n“Russia has not lost as much aircraft in the past 30 years as in 13 days in Ukraine,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his daily address to the nation on Tuesday.\nSatellite imagery analyzed by military analysts suggests that roughly 950 Russian vehicles, including 140 tanks, have been destroyed or damaged, according to Justin Bronk, a research fellow for air power and technology at the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank that specializes in security issues. That represents only a fraction of the invasion force, but is still striking.\nThe intelligence arm of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said on Tuesday that Maj. Gen. Vitaly Gerasimov, chief of staff of Russia’s 41st Army, had been killed outside the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, making him the second Russian general to die in the war.\nThe Ukrainians do not release a running tally of their own soldiers killed in action. But they often note the names of those who have died and bestow them with military honors.\nThe Kremlin, on the other hand, has forbidden the media in Russia from calling the invasion a war — it is a “special military operation,” in President Vladimir V. Putin’s phrase, and officially, everything is going according to plan.\nFour days into the war, the Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, acknowledged for the first time that “there are dead and wounded” Russian troops. But he offered no numbers, and insisted that Ukrainian losses were “many times” higher.\nTo be sure, it is in the interest of Ukraine and its many Western allies to promote Ukrainian victories and play up logistical and morale problems in the Russian ranks. According to what American officials described as conservative estimates, Ukrainian soldiers have killed more than 3,000 Russian troops. These officials, citing confidential U.S. intelligence assessments, said that Ukraine has also shot down military transport planes carrying Russian paratroopers, downed helicopters and blown holes in Russia’s convoys using American anti-tank missiles and armed drones supplied by Turkey.\nTaken together with witness accounts from the battlefield, it is increasingly clear that Russia has sustained heavy losses.",

      "text": "In the fall of 2020, just before Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine was found to be highly effective, the company pledged not to enforce patents on its vaccine during the pandemic. The company described the pledge as an effort to help hasten the end of the crisis, and it earned Moderna good will.\nOn Monday, Moderna announced that it was “updating” its pledge, opening up the possibility of enforcing its patents in middle- and high-income countries. The company said it would continue to “never enforce” its patents for Covid vaccines in 92 of the world’s poorest countries, many of them in Africa or Asia, or against other manufacturers making vaccines exclusively for those markets.\nIt was unclear precisely what the updated enforcement may look like, or what threats the company is responding to, in part because there is no manufacturing of Moderna vaccines other than by the company itself or its contractors.\nModerna’s patent pledge has yet to produce any results in part because the company hasn’t shared its vaccine formula or transferred its technology to manufacturers that could have produced it at a lower cost for poorer nations.\nAlthough South Africa is not included among the countries protected from patent enforcement, Moderna will not seek to block a World Health Organization-backed effort in South Africa to reverse-engineer the company’s Covid vaccine, said Colleen Hussey, a Moderna spokeswoman.\nDespite Moderna’s vow not to block that effort, Zain Rizvi of the advocacy group Public Citizen, who has researched Moderna’s Covid patents, said he is concerned that Moderna’s updated pledge could still “harm efforts to make the vaccine technology available in other developing countries.”\nModerna sold 800 million doses of its Covid vaccine to governments last year, generating $17.7 billion in revenue. The company has booked agreements to sell at least $19 billion worth of its vaccine this year. Pfizer, which manufactures the other mRNA vaccine widely used in the United States and elsewhere, has a similar policy of nonenforcement of its patents in the world’s poorest countries.\nNearly a year ago, when vaccines were in severely short supply in lower-income countries, the Biden administration supported a proposal before the World Trade Organization to waive intellectual property protections for Covid vaccines. That proposal, fiercely opposed by the pharmaceutical industry, has made little progress.\n In the news release on Monday, the company said it “remains willing” to license its Covid vaccine technology “on commercially reasonable terms” to manufacturers in middle- and high-income countries.",

      "text": "With the health care system in Ukraine facing urgent supply shortages, the head of the World Health Organization’s European region on Tuesday condemned attacks on health services and underscored the need for a humanitarian passage to deliver equipment and medicine to the hardest-hit regions.\nHans Kluge, the organization’s regional director for Europe, said with the clock ticking, “we need to get whatever we can to the affected areas.”\nHe added: “It should not need saying that health workers, hospitals and other medical facilities must never be a target at any time, including during crises and conflicts.”\nThe W.H.O. has confirmed 16 attacks — including the obstruction of services and incidents of physical and verbal violence — on health services in Ukraine, leading to at least nine deaths and 16 injuries. Shipments sent by the organization containing 76 tonnes, or about 84 tons, of trauma and emergency health supplies and other equipment, including freezers and 500 oxygen concentrators, were in transit in Ukraine, Dr. Kluge added. The organization said it had managed to dispatch five tonnes, or about 5.5 tons, of supplies to Kyiv, the country’s besieged capital.\nBut addressing shortages for essential medicines, particularly for those with chronic and noncommunicable illnesses, was a top priority, he said. Another was ensuring neighboring counties could accommodate the health needs of people fleeing the conflict. The United Nations said on Tuesday that more than two million people, largely women and children, have left the country since the invasion began.\n“All those seeking refuge, including internationals who had been residing in Ukraine, must be granted movement across Europe,” Dr. Kluge said, calling it “the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe for more than 75 years.” \nOfficials have made efforts to open corridors for the evacuation of civilians from cities under Russian bombardments, and to allow deliveries of humanitarian aid. But mistrust between the sides can make it difficult for agreements to stick, with cease-fire deals breaking down on Saturday and Sunday.\nEven without a clearly negotiated route, health workers on the ground cannot afford to wait, said Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the W.H.O. in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv.\n“We are doing internal planning here trying to see what routes we can use together with the health authorities to act as quickly as possible,” he said.",

      "text": "GENEVA — The United Nations’ top human rights official said on Tuesday that China would allow her to visit the country and examine conditions there, including in the Xinjiang region, a startling twist after years of negotiations and stonewalling by Beijing.\nIf the visit goes ahead in May as expected, the official, Michelle Bachelet, will be the first United Nations high commissioner for human rights in 17 years to visit China, which has faced repeated criticism for its human rights policies.\nThe visit is not without risk for the high commissioner’s reputation. As the United Nations’ top rights official, with a mandate to “promote and protect the enjoyment and full realization, by all people, of all human rights,” Ms. Bachelet has spoken out effectively against violations in many countries but only timidly against China.\nChina has long faced criticism for its harsh treatment of dissidents, journalists and activists, but rights groups have said that conditions have sharply deteriorated since President Xi Jinping took power a decade ago.\nBeijing has been accused of crimes against humanity in the mass incarceration of Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang — a set of policies that the U.S. State Department has called genocide — and it has also come under fire for a crackdown in Hong Kong that has essentially stripped the region of its independence from Beijing.\nChina has pushed back against criticism of its actions in Xinjiang, arguing that its policies have been highly effective in reducing poverty in one of the country’s least developed provinces and constitute a model of good counterterrorism practice.\nMs. Bachelet told the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Tuesday that her office would send an advance team to China next month to prepare for her visit. China’s ambassador to the council welcomed the proposed visit, but it was unclear why China had agreed to allow Ms. Bachelet to come to the country after her predecessors had failed to agree on the terms or the timing of a visit.\nFor her visit to succeed, her advance team will face the daunting task not just of arranging her itinerary and meetings with Chinese leaders, but also of attempting to ensure that she can meet with whomever she wishes, in conditions that will guarantee those people confidentiality and security.\nDespite the allegations of abuses amounting to crimes against humanity in China, Ms. Bachelet, in her statement to the Human Rights Council on Tuesday, spoke only of her concern about treatment of individuals who had faced restrictions on freedom of movement, house arrest or imprisonment.\nRights groups and governments have voiced particular frustration at Ms. Bachelet’s refusal to release a report prepared by her own office on abuses in Xinjiang. A spokesman said in December that the report would be released in weeks, but it remains unavailable and a spokeswoman for the high commissioner was unable on Tuesday to say when it would come out.\nSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken, addressing the Human Rights Council last week, accused China of genocide in Xinjiang and was one of several foreign ministers calling for the report’s publication. Amnesty International and nearly 200 other rights groups released a letter on Tuesday that similarly urged Ms. Bachelet to release the report without delay.\n“One of the best ways to ensure a meaningful visit is to release that report and make clear that she is pursuing evidence and accountability for crimes against humanity,” Sophie Richardson, the China director for Human Rights Watch, said in a telephone interview.\n“If she goes on this visit without having released the report she said she would release,” Ms. Richardson said, “it really raises questions about her basic willingness to confront Chinese authorities with all of the evidence her office has gathered about some of the most serious human rights abuses under international law.”",

      "headline": "A 459-Foot Mystery in a Tuscan Port: Is It a Russian’s Superyacht?",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/world/europe/russia-superyacht-putin-oligarch.html",
      "text": "From Germany’s North Sea ports to the French Riviera, open season has been declared on superyachts. Across Europe, authorities are hunting down luxury vessels tied to Russian oligarchs in the effort to inflict pain on President Vladimir V. Putin’s allies.\nIn Marina di Carrara, a small Italian town on the Tuscan coast, one of the world’s biggest, newest and most expensive superyachts — called the Scheherazade — is under scrutiny by the Italian police. Almost as long as a U.S. guided-missile destroyer, it dominates the waterfront.\nThe yacht, estimated by the website SuperYachtFan to cost about $700 million, has two helicopter decks and is studded with satellite domes. Inside, photos supplied by a former crew member show, is a swimming pool with a retractable cover that converts to a dance floor. Then there’s the fully equipped gym and the gold-plated fixtures in the bathrooms.\nIn the rarefied world of the biggest superyachts (only 14 that are at least 140 meters, or 459 feet long), the Scheherazade is alone in that no likely owner has been publicly identified. That has spurred speculation that it could be a Middle Eastern billionaire or a superconnected Russian — even Mr. Putin.\nThe ship’s captain, Guy Bennett-Pearce, a British national, denied that Mr. Putin owned or had ever been on the yacht. “I have never seen him. I have never met him,” he said. He added, in a phone interview from the yacht, that its owner was not on any sanctions list. He did not rule out that the person could be Russian, but declined to say more about the owner’s identity, citing a “watertight nondisclosure agreement.”\nCaptain Bennett-Pearce said that Italian investigators had come aboard on Friday and examined some of the ship’s certification documents. “They are looking hard. They are looking at every aspect,” he said. “This isn’t the local coppers coming down, these are men in dark suits.” A person familiar with the matter, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it, confirmed that the Italian financial police had opened an inquiry.\nOn Monday night, Captain Bennett-Pearce said he had “no choice” but to hand over documents revealing the owner’s identity to the Italian authorities. He said he would do so on Tuesday and had been told they would be handled with “confidentiality.”\n“I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that this will clear the vessel of all negative rumors and speculations,” he wrote in a message to a New York Times reporter.\nThe mystery about the ship’s owner arose because — even for the hyper-confidential world of superyachting — there is an unusual degree of secrecy surrounding this vessel. Not only do contractors and crew members sign nondisclosure agreements, as on many superyachts, but the ship also has a cover to hide its name plate. And when it first arrived at the port, workers erected a tall metallic barrier on the pier to partly obscure the yacht from onlookers. Some locals remarked that they had never seen anything like it for other boats.\nIn his State of the Union address last week, President Biden announced a Justice Department task force to go after oligarchs close to Mr. Putin and facing sanctions in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Sanctions have been imposed against hundreds of people, and the list keeps growing.\nLast week, French authorities seized the yacht Amore Vero near Marseille as it was preparing to depart, claiming it was owned by a man on that list: Igor Sechin, the head of the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft. In Italy, police in Sanremo impounded Lena, a yacht belonging to Gennady Timchenko, a Putin friend who controls an oil exporting company. In nearby Imperia, police also impounded the Lady M, a yacht belonging to Alexei Mordashov, Russia’s richest man. The fate of the Dilbar, one of the world’s biggest yachts that the United States says belongs to the oligarch Alisher Usmanov, is unclear. It is in Hamburg, and German officials said the vessel could not leave without an export waiver, Bloomberg News reported.\nSome of the biggest superyachts are owned by Russians who are not on the sanctions list. The world’s second-largest, Eclipse, which has a missile defense system and a mini submarine, is owned by Roman Abramovich, the billionaire who is selling his ownership stake in the British soccer club Chelsea. Andrey Melnichenko, a billionaire coal baron, owns Sailing Yacht A.\nDetermining the ownership of assets that the wealthy want to keep hidden is difficult, especially without a warrant, because they are often zealously guarded by private bankers and lawyers and tucked away in opaque shell companies in offshore secrecy havens. The Scheherazade is flagged in the Cayman Islands and its owner, Bielor Assets Ltd., is registered in the Marshall Islands. The yacht’s management company, which Captain Bennett-Pearce says is also registered in the Cayman Islands, works from the ship and uses his rental villa in nearby Lucca as its address.\nOne trade website, which bills itself as “the global authority in superyachting,” claims that the vessel’s owner is “known to be a Middle Eastern billionaire.” The Scheherazade shares a name with the female storyteller in “The Arabian Nights,” and it made one brief foray into the Red Sea in September 2020, calling at the Egyptian port of Hurghada. But mostly it stays in Marina di Carrara, where it has been moored since last September.\nLocals have their own theory about the ship’s ownership. Some have heard people onboard speaking Russian. And Scheherazade is also the title of a symphonic work by the Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.\n“Everybody calls it Putin’s yacht, but nobody knows whose it is,” said Ernesto Rossi, a retired clerk who was taking a walk along the marina’s promenade on Friday. “It’s a rumor that’s been going around for months.”\nIn Italy, the phrase “Putin’s yacht” has become shorthand for a mysterious and ultra-luxurious ship. It’s also a joke among the dozens of crew members, Captain Bennett-Pearce said. “I’ve heard the same rumors.”\nAnother, smaller vessel, the Graceful, has long been tied to the Russian president and is known as “Putin’s yacht.” It was tracked leaving Germany for the Russian port of Kaliningrad just weeks before the invasion of Ukraine. (U.S. government officials point out that Mr. Putin owns little outright; many of the luxurious homes or ships he uses are owned by oligarchs.)\nMr. Putin appears to have a penchant for big pleasure boats. During his time as Russia’s leader, he’s been photographed on yachts from Russia’s northern reaches to the Black Sea in the south. Last May, he and Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, took a cruise on a yacht at the Black Sea resort city of Sochi.\nThe Scheherazade’s builder, Lurssen Group, whose website promises customers “complete confidentiality,” declined to comment about its ownership. Until June 2020, when the completed ship left the pier in Bremen, Germany, it had the code name “Lightning.” The same company built the even bigger superyacht the Dilbar. A similar gigantic yacht, code-named “Luminance,” is now being built at Lurssen, scheduled to be completed next year.\n“Of course, all orders and projects of the Lurssen Group and its subsidiaries are treated in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations,” said Oliver Grun, a company spokesman.\nAbout 70 percent of the Scheherazade’s crew is Russian, Captain Bennett-Pearce said. And during each of the past two summers, it has sailed to Sochi, the last time in early July 2021, according to MarineTraffic, a top maritime analytics provider. The ship’s construction was managed by Imperial Yachts, a company in Monaco that, Reuters reported, manages the Amore Vero, Mr. Sechin’s seized yacht. Nick Flashman, who oversees construction of large vessels at Imperial Yachts, declined to comment.\nOne former crew member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the nondisclosure agreement, said that shipmates called it “Putin’s yacht.” The person said the ship was manned by an international crew during “boss off” times; when it was “boss on,” the crew was replaced by an all-Russian staff. In the weeks before the Scheherazade’s 2020 trip to the Black Sea, the foreign crew was dismissed, the person said.\nThe former crew member supplied photos of rosters of both international and Russian crew members. The Times reached out, via social media, phone or email, to at least 17 of them. Few responded.\nOne of the Russians said only that he had worked on the Scheherazade, citing a nondisclosure agreement. Another person said it would be dangerous to talk. One man denied serving on the vessel; another said he hadn’t worked at sea in 25 years.\nCaptain Bennett-Pearce said “categorically there is not a European crew that comes on and a Russian crew that comes on.” Many of the ship’s senior officers are from Britain, New Zealand and Spain. Many international crew members were dismissed in 2020, replaced by Russians who didn’t demand the high salaries and benefits that their predecessors had, the captain said. “It came down to economics,” he said.\nGiven the antipathy that people outside of Russia have toward Mr. Putin, if the Russian president really were the owner or principal user of the yacht, keeping non-Russian senior crew members like him on staff would make no sense, Captain Bennett-Pearce said.\n“If there’s a European crew onboard it’s the biggest smoke and mirror and the biggest risk I’ve ever heard of,” he said.",

      "text": "LONDON — Charlotte Shevchenko-Knight flipped through old family photo albums and toured the snowy neighborhoods of the Ukrainian capital when she visited her grandparents in Kyiv in January.\nThen, their whole world changed.\nOn Monday, she spoke to them by video chat from her home in England after they crossed the border into Romania, fleeing the Russian military assault. She said she had never seen them so exhausted. Now her grandparents and an aunt are facing another nightmarish hurdle, said Ms. Shevchenko-Knight, 25. But this time, it is a bureaucratic and logistical one as they try to secure a visa under Britain’s new plan to issue them to Ukrainian families of British residents.\n“It should just be: ‘You’re fleeing a war. We can welcome you,’” she said of the British response. “I don’t understand. It’s just really inhuman.”\nThe Russian attack has triggered the fastest displacement of people in Europe since World War II. More than 2 million Ukrainians have fled since last month, according to the United Nations, and many more are expected to join the exodus. Much of Europe has allowed the refugees to enter without visas, but Britain has required visas and an application process that is confusing many and slowing their arrival in Britain.\nThe website for information and applications has crashed or stalled repeatedly, people are struggling to find safe routes to the handful of application centers across Europe, and even when they do, they are unable to book the required appointments for weeks. The only application center in Ukraine is in the western city of Lviv near the Polish border, which had been inundated with people trying to flee the country. But it closed suddenly over the weekend.\nOn Tuesday, the government said it had issued visas to 500 Ukrainians so far. Many other European countries have welcomed thousands without visas, the bulk of refugees fleeing to Ukraine’s neighbors. Poland has taken in more than 1.2 million people.\nBoth Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Priti Patel, the home secretary, have heralded the program, claiming that up to 200,000 Ukrainians could eventually come to Britain. The government said that 17,700 applications had been started.\nWhile opposition lawmakers and the British public have joined calls for dropping the visa requirement altogether, Mr. Johnson has so far rejected the idea, telling reporters on Monday that Britain was already a “very generous country,” but needed to vet the newcomers.\nThe system has drawn criticism from aid groups, legal experts, families and other European leaders who say the British response is paltry in the face of such an enormous crisis. They cited the limited eligibility and an opaque and confusing visa application process for people ill equipped under the circumstances to deal with that level of bureaucratic red tape.\nMala Savjani, an associate lawyer with Wilson Solicitors, a London firm that specializes in immigration and has been advising several Ukrainian families, said that the practical aspects of the program have been flawed since it was announced last week.\n“It is so contradictory to what these people are actually experiencing,” she said. “It is being thought of in terms of a visa application process, the actual circumstances that people are in — quite literally being in the middle of a war and fleeing — has not really been thought about properly.”\nUnder the program, extended family members of permanent British residents are eligible to enter the country. But they must submit an online form, then go to a visa center for biometrics. Once a visa decision is made, they receive documents to travel to Britain.\n“I think it feels particularly difficult when there is such a different reaction going on in Europe,” Ms. Savjani said.\nMs. Patel was grilled in Parliament on Monday by opposition Labour lawmakers critical of the government’s response.\nA petition to see the country waive all visa requirements had about 150,000 signatures from the public by Tuesday.\nThe Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, in a letter to the British government last week, urged the lifting of the visa requirements.\n“Gaps created by the piecemeal nature of measures, and the impracticality of many of the requirements for persons escaping a war zone, are causing confusion, uncertainty, further distress and impediments to access to safety in the U.K. for an already vulnerable group of people,” the letter said.\nFrance’s interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, criticized what he called a “lack of humanity” in Britain’s response — one of many barbs that the French and British governments have traded in recent years over the issue of migrants crossing the English Channel.\nMr. Darmanin, in a letter sent to Ms. Patel, said that the British response so far had been “totally inadequate” and noted that Ukrainian families in the French port of Calais were being told by British authorities to go to Paris or Brussels to apply for a visa.\n“The British need to put their words — I heard Mr. Johnson’s generous speeches — into action,” Mr. Darmanin told Europe 1 radio.\nMs. Patel said Monday that the government was in the process of setting up a visa application center near Calais, which has long been a starting point for people trying to cross the English Channel. But then on Tuesday, the government said that center would instead be in Lille, France, some 70 miles away from Calais.\nThe Home Office said it had increased staffing at its application centers in the European Union, adding that it was working to process applications as quickly as possible.\nBut for many families, it is not quick enough.\nMary Fesenko, 24, grew up in Kyiv with her grandparents, but moved to England with her mother during high school.\n“Every day, I see heartbreaking footage of familiar buildings and streets that carry my happiest childhood memories being destroyed,” she said, explaining how she scans videos to see if her family home has been shelled.\nHer grandparents fled Kyiv and traveled to the relative safety of western Ukraine to get to the visa application center in Lviv, but soon realized it had closed and couldn’t find anywhere to stay. From there, they managed to get to Poland, and met Ms. Fesenko’s mother who had flown in from England.\nThe only appointment she could book for them at the visa application center in Warsaw is a month away, Ms. Fesenko said.\nSteve Valdez-Symonds, the refugee and migrant rights program director for Amnesty U.K., said the approach is indicative of the government’s general attitude toward refugees and asylum seekers.\n“We have had, for a very long time in this country, successive governments who have not really been welcoming to refugees,” he said.\n“And it’s not even clear, really, whether what ministers say when the media and public spotlight is on them and they feel under pressure is really what they are committed to.”\nDespite the messages of a generous welcome, recent policies suggest otherwise, he added, pointing to the thousands of Afghan refugees still languishing in hotels months after being evacuated as one example.\nThis weekend, Khrystyna Daines’ parents and grandparents, who live in Lviv and are applying for a visa to join Ms. Daines and her husband in England, tried to go to the visa application center in the city only to find it closed.\n“It’s just a nightmare, to be honest, and you can’t wake up,” said Ms. Daines, 31.\nHer husband, Thomas Daines, 32, said that most people he speaks with don’t seem to understand that it is British citizens, like him and his wife, who have to bear the pain of being separated from family.\n“I think these have probably been the worst weeks of our lives,” Mr. Daines said. “If we were in a neighboring country, we could just get in our car and bring them back.”",

      "text": "Ukraine’s vice prime minister said on Monday that internet terminals sent by Elon Musk, which were designed to work with satellites orbiting in space to provide online access, had arrived in the country.\nOne of Mr. Musk’s companies, SpaceX, has deployed thousands of satellites into low-Earth orbit over the past three years as part of its business to beam high-speed internet service from more than 100 miles above the planet.\nSatellite internet services like Mr. Musk’s, which is known as Starlink, can be useful in parts of the world where people cannot easily access conventional internet providers, whether because of technical limitations, government restrictions or other barriers.\nThere have been a number of internet disruptions in Ukraine since the Russian invasion began last week. On Saturday, Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov of Ukraine, who is also the minister of digital transformation, wrote to Mr. Musk on Twitter to ask for Starlink stations.\n“While you try to colonize Mars — Russia try to occupy Ukraine!” Mr. Fedorov wrote. “While your rockets successfully land from space — Russian rockets attack Ukrainian civil people!”\nMr. Musk, a billionaire entrepreneur who is also the chief executive of the electric-car maker Tesla, said that the Starlink service was now active in Ukraine and that he was sending more of the terminals users would need to access a satellite internet signal through the system.\nMr. Fedorov posted a photo on Twitter on Monday that appeared to show a military truck loaded with Starlink terminals.\n“Starlink — here,” he wrote, and thanked Mr. Musk.\n“You are most welcome,” Mr. Musk wrote back.\nIt was unclear as of early Tuesday how many Starlink terminals had arrived in the country, where they would be available or who would be allowed to use them. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "headline": "‘My Cousins Are Killing One Another’: War in Ukraine Splits Mixed Families",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-families.html",
      "text": "To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android.\nAs a child in the Russian city of Volgograd, Nina Ryakhovskaya grew up with her younger cousin, sliding in their socks on their grandmother’s wooden floor, pretending to be figure skaters and confiding secrets and crushes to each other.\nNow 40, and living in Kyiv with her Ukrainian husband, Ms. Ryakhovskaya recently called her cousin in Volgograd to tell her the Russians were invading Ukraine. Her cousin did not believe there was an invasion and told her that Russia was only conducting an operation against Nazis there, she said.\n“It makes me feel like we are distant forever,” Ms. Ryakhovskaya said in a video call from a house in the countryside near Kyiv, where she fled with her husband and 7-year-old son as the Russian invasion unfolded. “I can’t forgive them, I can’t forgive that they are part of this.”\nBecause of their countries’ complex and intertwined history, many Ukrainians and Russians have relatives from both sides of the border who are now standing on opposite sides of the war. The conflict triggered by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has gone beyond the front lines and into the families of many Ukrainians and Russians, as well as the diasporas of those peoples around the world.\nThe war has already created family rifts and prompted fears among some that relatives will harm each other in battle.\n“I have cousins on both sides,” said Dan Hubbard, a professor at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia. “I dread them killing each other.”\nMr. Hubbard, 64, was raised in the United States by his mother, who was Russian, and his Ukrainian great-grandmother. He fondly recalled how the two women used to share homemade cabbage pie while playing cards and making fun of each other’s accents.\nToday, some members of his family live near Moscow and others are outside of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, which is now under siege by Russian forces. Both his Russian and Ukrainian cousins are old enough to enlist in the army. Mr. Hubbard says he has been trying to avoid the news because it causes him too much pain.\n“I feel for both sides because Russian boys don’t even know why they are there,” he said. “My cousins are killing one another because of a madman’s fantasy.”\nZoya, a 25-year-old assistant at a cosmetics company in St. Petersburg, is the daughter of a Russian mother and a Ukrainian father. She grew up near Moscow, but her paternal grandmother spoke to her in Ukrainian, read her Ukrainian poems and sang her Ukrainian songs.\n“This conflict is like when your mom and dad have a fight,” said Zoya, who, like several people interviewed for this article, asked to be identified only by her first name for fear of repercussions in Russia. “You can’t choose one of them because you love them both.”\nIn a 2011 poll, 49 percent of Ukrainians said they had relatives in Russia, and there were 2.6 million Ukrainian citizens living in Russia in 2015, according to one study.\nWith a Russian mother and a Ukrainian father, Alona Cherkassky grew up in Moscow but spent her summers in Odessa, Ukraine, where her grandparents lived. As an adult, she prided herself on her double heritage. But with the Russian invasion, it has become a source of pain.\n“It feels like a very personal attack,” said Ms. Cherkassky, 45, who now lives in London.\nMs. Cherkassky’s cousin Georgy, 44, a Russian animator, lives in Moscow with his wife, who is from Odessa, the seaside city where the Russian Navy came ashore during the invasion. He said that his wife did not separate her Ukrainian identity from her adoptive Russian one until recently.\n“Of course since they are bombing her homeland, she is thinking of herself more as Ukrainian,” Georgy said.\nThe kinship bond between Russians and Ukrainians that many people of mixed origin described has also been emphasized by Mr. Putin, who has repeatedly pointed out that the countries share a common heritage. But while for many this closeness made the invasion even more devastating, for Mr. Putin it was a justification for it.\n“On the one side, our president says we’re all one people,” said Georgy, “but on the other side, he’s bombing them.”\nOlena, who has a Russian mother and a Ukrainian father, said her parents were sheltering underground from Russian shelling in the eastern Ukrainian region of Sumy, near the Russian border.\nOlena said she grew up in both Ukraine and Russia, speaking a mix of both languages, reading literature and listening to a cross-border mix of pop music.\nNow she lives in France, and she reads her children Russian and Ukrainian fairy tales and sings lullabies to them from both countries. But since Russia’s invasion, her children have started to ask which country is theirs.\n“How can I say I am more Russian or more Ukrainian?” she asked. “I never needed to.”\nSome people torn between the two countries expressed their distress on social media.\n“My son is almost 6. His mother’s country of birth bombs his father’s,” Alexander Kolyandr, who identified himself as an analyst for an investment bank in Moscow, wrote on Twitter.\n“My mom’s from Russia, my dad’s a Russian speaker from Ukraine,” Evan Gershkovich, a Moscow correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, wrote on Twitter on the war’s first day. “Today still isn’t computing even after weeks of watching this develop in real time.”\nIn the house where she is staying in the Ukrainian countryside, Ms. Ryakhovskaya said she was freezing because when she left Kyiv she was in shock and took only summer clothes. She has now become scared of the dark. At night, she and her family only use headlamps so as to not attract the attention of Russian troops by turning on the house lights.\nThe fallout with her family in Russia has only added to her distress.\n“It’s even harder because you lose your relatives,” she said. “They don’t believe a person they know from their childhood,” she added. “They believe the TV.”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/world/middleeast/israel-palestinians-evictions.html",
      "text": "JERUSALEM — Israel’s Supreme Court handed a partial victory on Tuesday to a group of Palestinian families whose looming eviction from their homes in East Jerusalem contributed to the tensions that led to last year’s 11-day Gaza war.\nAfter years of legal struggles, Israel’s highest court accepted the main argument of the families, allowing them to remain in their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood until the dispute over the ownership of the property is settled — a process that experts said could take years, if it gets settled at all.\nIn the interim, the court ruled, the four families can remain in their houses as protected tenants and pay a reduced annual rent of about $750 each into a trust account, with the money eventually going to whoever wins the ownership rights.\nThe court decision defused a potentially explosive issue, even as tensions in East Jerusalem remain high.\nWhile Sheikh Jarrah is now predominantly Arab, a small Jewish community lived in the neighborhood from the late 19th century until the war leading to the establishment of Israel in 1948, after which the area fell under Jordanian control.\nIsrael captured the eastern part of the city, including Sheikh Jarrah, from Jordan in the 1967 war, then annexed it in a move that most countries of the world never recognized.\nThe Palestinian families and activists challenging the evictions argued that they were part of a wider Israeli effort to displace Palestinians from East Jerusalem in order to cement Israel’s claim to sovereignty there.\nThe Supreme Court judges wrote in their ruling on Tuesday that “at the core of the process lies the complex history of Jerusalem and the changes of government that took place there.”\nIn the 1950s, Jordan built houses for Palestinian refugee families in what had been the Jewish compound, though it never transferred ownership to the families. After Israel took control of the area, the ownership was transferred to two Jewish associations, which later sold the rights to a Jewish settlement group.\nThe Palestinian residents were allowed to stay on as protected tenants on the condition that they paid rent to the new owners, but many of the Palestinian families refused on principle.\nFor years, the Israeli courts have treated the house-by-house ownership battle as a legalistic property dispute. But the land has powerful attachments to Palestinians and Jews.\nThe Jewish community in Sheikh Jarrah was centered around a shrine held by Jews to be the ancient tomb of Shimon Hatzadik, or Simeon the Just, a Jewish high priest from the days of the Second Temple. And since Israel captured East Jerusalem in 1967, successive Israeli leaders have promised their capital city would never again be divided.\nPalestinians have long demanded East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state.\nThe eviction cases have also highlighted a legal double standard: The families settled in Sheikh Jarrah by Jordan were Palestinian refugees from what is now Israel. While Jewish Israelis can reclaim land they owned in East Jerusalem before 1948, Palestinians have no similar legal recourse to reclaim homes they once owned in what became Israel.\nFour months ago, the same four families rejected a compromise proposed by the court along similar lines of the ruling on Tuesday because it did not recognize them as the owners of their homes and it would have required them to pay rent to the settler organizations.\nThis time, said Sami Arsheid, a lawyer representing the families, since it was a court ruling, “it was not a matter of agreeing or not.”\nThe families would have to respect the court decision, he said, while being given the chance to prove their ownership without the threat of imminent eviction.\nMr. Arsheid said it was up to the Ministry of Justice to decide how to proceed regarding settling the ownership rights. The process has been “frozen since 1967,” he said, and was not about to be finalized any time soon.\nHe added that Tuesday’s ruling could affect the cases of several other Palestinian families facing eviction, including nine more from Sheikh Jarrah that are still making their way through the courts.\nItamar Ben Gvir, a far-right member of Parliament who supports the Jewish settlers, decried the court’s decision as a “dark, illegal, undemocratic decision that runs contrary to the values of the rule of law and constitutes a very grave precedent that will be enjoyed by squatters.”\nMr. Ben Gvir recently set up his parliamentary office in a tent in Sheikh Jarrah, in a ploy, he said, to bring more police and security to the area to protect the Jewish settlers from attack, but his presence has ratcheted up tensions there.\nThe court ruling could help calm the situation in Sheikh Jarrah, which has been the scene of frequent clashes, but violence has recently flared elsewhere in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.\nClashes between Palestinians and the police have occurred at another frequent flash point, Damascus Gate, one of the main entrances to Jerusalem’s Old City. A Palestinian girl was injured there on Monday after being hit in the jaw by a police stun grenade.\nOvernight, two Palestinian men were reported killed by Israeli forces during a confrontation in the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank where border police officers were conducting an arrest raid.\nOn Tuesday, a third Palestinian man was killed by Israeli army fire in the southern West Bank.\nThe Israeli military said soldiers spotted two “suspects” approaching an Israeli memorial in the West Bank and fired at them as they fled. One was later declared dead, the military said.",

      "text": "For the second time in three days, service on the London Underground was severely disrupted on Thursday because of a worker strike.\nAfter a 24-hour strike on Tuesday led to widespread delays on the rail system, commonly called the Tube, commuters were again encouraged to work remotely on Thursday because of expected “severe disruptions.”\nOfficials warned commuters to consider alternative modes of transportation, like walking or cycling, and said that if any Tube service was provided it would not continue into the evening. The strike was also expected to “severely impact” services on Friday, officials said, with no service until at least 8 a.m.\nAbout 10,000 London Underground workers represented by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers have walked out this week over concerns about job reductions and pensions.\nThe Underground, like many public transportation systems around the world, has seen steep declines in ridership and revenues during the coronavirus pandemic. Tuesday’s strike came on the same day as an increase in rail fares in England and Wales.\n“These are the very same transport staff praised as heroes for carrying London through Covid for nearly two years, often at serious personal risk, who now have no option but to strike to defend their livelihoods,” the union said in a statement last week.\nTransport for London, the agency that operates the Underground, said in a statement that it had not proposed any changes to pensions and that cost-saving efforts would not cause job losses.\nThe strike and fare increases are taking place in London amid concerns about funding for the transportation system as it has struggled to recover from the pandemic.\nPassengers in many cities and countries have returned to public transportation at an uneven rate after waves of coronavirus variants kept many commuters at home and sickened transit workers.\nIn New York City, subway ridership at the start of this year fell to about 40 percent of prepandemic levels as Omicron cases surged.\nAcross Britain, public transit passenger levels have recovered at slower rates than in other parts of Europe. In August, ridership was 29 percent lower in Britain than it had been before the pandemic, while it was just 10 percent lower in Germany, France and Switzerland, according to an analysis by economists at ING, the Dutch bank.\nBefore the strikes in London, the city’s transport agency said in a statement that Tube and bus ridership increased in late January after work-from-home restrictions were lifted. Tube ridership on weekdays in that period was “regularly around” 60 percent of what it was before the pandemic, the agency said.\nOn Friday, Britain’s Department for Transport announced that it had agreed to 200 million pounds, or about $268 million, in funding for London’s transit agency through June 24. It said the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, would be expected to come up with a plan for cost savings and for moving the transport workers’ pension fund “into a financially sustainable position.”\nThe mayor, who last month provided details about the 4.8 percent fare increase in London, said in a statement last week that the short-term funding by the central government would allow services to keep running only “for a few more months.” He said longer-term funding was needed to avoid “significant and damaging cuts to Tube and bus services.”\n“The pandemic is the only reason TfL is facing a financial crisis,” Mr. Khan said, referring to the transit agency. “TfL has a critical role to play in driving the recovery and it supports tens of thousands of jobs across the U.K., but the government’s short-term deals are trapping TfL on life support and putting economic growth and jobs at risk.”\nThe fare increase comes amid fears in Britain that escalating utility bills and food prices could push millions into poverty. Many Britons have been forced to cut expenses as prices have risen at their fastest pace in three decades.\nManuel Cortes, the general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association, the union for the transport and travel trade industries, slammed the government on Monday over the decision to raise fares, saying it was “staggeringly stupid” to do so as the country was struggling to emerge from the pandemic.\n“Rail could and should be central to our economic recovery from Covid, but instead, pushing up fares will price many people off the network, with domestic budgets stretched in this ongoing cost-of-living crisis,” he said.",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/world/europe/ukraine-russia-oligarchs-uk.html",
      "text": "LONDON — Eighteen months ago, Evgeny Lebedev was ushered into the clubby inner circle of aristocratic Britain: the House of Lords, to which he had been nominated for a life peerage by his good friend, Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\nThis week, Mr. Lebedev, a 41-year-old Russian-British newspaper baron, found himself on far less comfortable ground. Writing on the front page of his paper, London’s Evening Standard, Mr. Lebedev implored President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to call off his brutal invasion of Ukraine.\n“As a Russian citizen I plead with you to stop Russians killing their Ukrainian brothers and sisters,” said Mr. Lebedev, whose father was once a K.G.B. officer. “As a British citizen I ask you to save Europe from war. As a Russian patriot I plead that you prevent any more young Russian soldiers from dying needlessly.”\nMr. Lebedev’s carefully calibrated message reflected the suddenly tricky landscape for wealthy Russians in Britain. Mr. Putin’s assault has thrown a harsh spotlight on oligarchs: Most amassed their fortunes thanks to their ties to the Russian leader. They have used London, with its laissez-faire regulatory climate, as a haven to stash wealth or to launder ill-gotten gains.\nNow, with most of the Western world uniting against Mr. Putin’s aggression, Britain is moving to plug an embarrassing loophole to which it has long turned a blind eye.\nOn Tuesday, the government introduced new legislation in Parliament to try to curb the gusher of dirty money into Britain. Under the law, known as the Economic Crime Bill, foreign companies that own property would have to declare the true owners or could ultimately risk confiscation of their assets.\n“They are beginning to feel the heat,” Misha Glenny, author of “McMafia,” a book on organized crime that inspired a popular TV series, said of the oligarchs. But he said of the plans to tighten the rules, “There is an element of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.”\nThe new legislation is targeted directly at elite Russians, who have hired battalions of lawyers, bankers and accountants to help them hide their wealth, much of which was amassed through cronyism. Many shield their identities behind shell companies that own property in London’s gilded neighborhoods.\nTransparency International, which campaigns against corruption, estimates that 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) of British real estate has been bought by Russians accused of corruption or of having links to the Kremlin. Of that, almost 430 million pounds of property is in Westminster, near the heart of government, while 283 million pounds is in affluent Kensington and Chelsea.\nThe new legislation also aims to strengthen the use of “unexplained wealth orders,” a legal tool allowing the government to seize assets owned by people who cannot prove they were bought with legitimate funds. Since 2018, such orders have been invoked only nine times in four cases. Prosecutors have been reluctant to press cases because they can incur huge legal costs if the prosecutions fail.\n“This is a significant step forward in terms of tackling Russian money,” said Rachel Davies, head of advocacy at Transparency International U.K. “These are long overdue promises from the government which are finally coming to fruition.” But she added, “there are gaps that the government needs to address.”\nAmong them is an exemption for real estate purchased more than 20 years ago. And there would be an 18-month transition period before the law came into effect, giving wealthy owners ample opportunity to sell out.\nIn an interview with ITV on Tuesday, Mr. Johnson, striving to claim the higher ground on this issue, said of those oligarchs who had not spoken out about Ukraine that their “silence is inexplicable.”\nTo critics, Britain’s action is too little, too late. The government first committed to making these changes six years ago. Yet before Russia moved against Ukraine last week, Mr. Johnson had been expected to push off the measures until at least 2023.\n“The flow of dirty money into the U.K. and U.S. has been undermining our national security for years,” said Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative who is chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the House of Commons. “Since 2018, I’ve been warning that we’re paying for our enemies’ weapons.”\nMr. Tugendhat, whose name has surfaced in recent weeks as a potential successor to Mr. Johnson, has said Britain needs to move away from targeting individuals with “vague” sanctions. Instead, he said, it must impose penalties with teeth, like barring Russian companies from British markets and expelling family members of Russians linked to Mr. Putin.\nSkeptics wonder how hard the government will push, not just because legal, financial, and other firms have benefited hugely from Russian cash, but also because donations have flowed to Mr. Johnson’s Conservative Party.\nSince he became prime minister in 2019, the party, or its individual constituency associations, have received 1.93 million pounds ($2.5 million) from donors who are either Russian or who made money from Russia, according to calculations by the opposition Labour Party, based on disclosures to the Electoral Commission.\nRussians who have donated to the Tories, according to the commission’s register, include the industrialist Alexander Temerko and the financier Lubov Chernukhin, with whom Mr. Johnson played tennis in exchange for a check before he became prime minister. While foreigners are not allowed to donate to political parties, those who acquire British citizenship can.\nNobody is a better example of the cozy ties between Russians and the establishment than Mr. Lebedev. Mr. Johnson has been a weekend guest at his converted castle in Italy. When the prime minister submitted Mr. Lebedev’s name to the House of Lords Appointments Committee, Britain’s security agencies raised red flags, according to a person familiar with the process.\nWhile there is no suggestion that Mr. Lebedev acts as an agent for the Russian government, he inherited his fortune from his father Alexander, who once worked for the K.G.B. and later became an oligarch. The office of the younger Mr. Lebedev did not respond to a request for comment.\n“What Lebedev reflects is the utter, shameful hypocrisy of the British government and the Tory Party in particular,” Mr. Glenny said.\nFor Mr. Johnson, the privileged status of oligarchs has become a sore point abroad. During a visit to Poland on Tuesday, a Ukrainian journalist, Daria Kaleniuk, lashed out at him, saying that while children fleeing Ukraine were being subjected to Russian bombardment, London provided a refuge for the children of Roman Abramovich, a billionaire with longstanding ties to Mr. Putin.\n“I’m acutely conscious that there is not enough we can do, as the U.K. government, to help in the way that you want,” an abashed Mr. Johnson responded.\nMr. Abramovich, who owns the Chelsea soccer club, has moved to insulate his prize asset, announcing he would turn over the “stewardship and care” of the club to its charitable foundation, though he will continue to own it. The next day, Chelsea issued a carefully worded statement that said, “the situation in Ukraine is horrific and devastating” and that it was “praying for peace.”\nIn recent days, Mr. Abramovich, who also holds Israeli and Portuguese passports, said he had been contacted by Ukrainian officials to act as a mediator with Mr. Putin. None of this has stopped a Labour lawmaker, Chris Bryant, from demanding that Mr. Abramovich be stripped of his ownership of Chelsea.\nFor those who have inveighed against dirty money for years, it is hard to shake a sense of cynicism that things will ever change.\n“There is a reason that London is the money laundering capital of the world,” said William F. Browder, an American-born British financier who worked in Russia and has campaigned against corruption and human-rights abuses there. “This is the land of grand announcements and shockingly bad implementation.”\nStill, Mr. Browder said he believed that the harrowing images from Ukraine would shift the ground under the oligarchs, making life uncomfortable for them in ways that no previous conflict had done. On Tuesday, a Conservative lawmaker, Bob Seely, read out in Parliament the names of lawyers who represent oligarchs.\n“It used to be OK to be in the House of Lords and moonlight for an oligarch on the side,” Mr. Browder said. “It used to be totally reasonable to go to a party on an oligarch’s yacht. We’re in a whole new world now.”",

      "headline": "A Surge of Unifying Moral Outrage Over Russia’s War",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/world/europe/zelensky-ukraine-war-outrage.html",
      "text": "PARIS — The man the Kremlin holds in dismissive contempt, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, has emerged as an online hero. His Twitter account has leapt by hundreds of thousands of followers a day (he now has 4.3 million). Often dressed in olive-green fleece and cargo pants, he has accused Russia of war crimes, signed a formal application to join the European Union, and morphed into a symbol of hope and grace under pressure.\nAs Russia pursues its ruthless invasion, Mr. Zelensky has used social media adroitly to outmaneuver his nemesis, President Vladimir V. Putin. So, too, have many of the 44 million citizens of Ukraine. TikTok, the video-sharing app with more than a billion active users, has shaped views of the conflict and contributed to an intense wave of global sympathy for Ukraine. Call it Resistance 4.0, the influencers’ war against an unprovoked Russian invasion.\nMr. Putin’s assault against a phantom “genocide” in Ukraine meets the nimbleness, even the humor, of a people unified and galvanized by the Russian leader’s obsessive talk of their nonexistence as a nation. The Russian leader also claims the war is nonexistent and is in fact “a special military operation.”\nTechnology, blamed of late for every ill from the death of truth to the spread of loneliness, restores feeling and revives human connection as the war unfolds. Brave civilians brandishing newly acquired rifles against armored divisions cannot leave the onlooker cold.\n“I don’t really have any choice because this is my home,” Hlib Bondarenko, a computer programmer who has lined up for his weapon in Kyiv, tells The New York Times in a video. This is not the remote, clinical war of drones and satellites. It poses perhaps the most acute moral question of war, especially one pitting the weak and righteous against Goliath: What would I do?\nThe answer appears to be: something, at least. Protest marches have unfurled under blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags across Europe and the United States, from Chicago to Warsaw, from Berlin to New York. Ukrainians living abroad have lined up to return home and fight. As with the Spanish Civil War, when volunteers flocked to support the left-leaning government against a military rebellion, the conscience of Europe has stirred. Taboos have tumbled.\nSwedish and Finnish and Swiss neutrality has evaporated. Postwar Germany’s refusal to prioritize military spending and send arms to conflict zones has ended. A united 27-nation European Union has decided, for the first time, to provide Ukraine with more than half-a-billion dollars in aid for lethal weapons. The outright collapse of the Russian economy is declared an objective by the French economy minister.\n“It’s a sea change,” said Anne-Claire Legendre, the spokeswoman for the French Foreign Ministry. “A new world has defied Putin, the master of propaganda.”\nSalomé Zourabichvili, the president of Georgia, told France Inter, a French radio station, that “Putin has already failed because he has given birth to a monster: European power and European defense.”\nThe outcome of the five-day-old war is of course still in the balance, with Russia unleashing a rocket assault on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, and a Russian military convoy, at least 40 miles long, poised north of Kyiv. But if Mr. Putin planned a blitzkrieg to decapitate Ukraine in short order, the impact of his plan with reality has been confounding.\nNowhere has the European sea change been more pronounced than in Germany, where one legacy of Nazism was reluctance to exercise national power to the full. Another was hesitancy over confronting Russia, one of the countries Hitler invaded. All that ended on the date of the Russian invasion, Feb. 24, 2022, “a turning point in the history of our continent,” as Chancellor Olaf Scholz said.\nHe told the Bundestag, the Parliament, on Sunday that “at the heart of the matter is whether power can break the law.” That was also the question in Berlin in 1933 as Hitler took control. It is therefore an existential question for Germany. The essential issue, Mr. Scholz said, was whether “we find it within ourselves to set limits to an international warmonger like Putin.”\nThe war, in other words, is a pivotal moral challenge to the 21st-century world, as seen by the power that committed the greatest moral outrage of the last century.\nThis, after all, is a war in which a nuclear power, Russia, confronts a state, Ukraine, that gave up its nuclear weapons in 1994 in exchange for Russian promises that its sovereignty and territorial integrity would be respected.\nMr. Putin’s Russia leveled Grozny during the Chechnya war. It leveled Aleppo in Syria. Can it level Kyiv with a TikTok world watching? The question hangs over the war as the Russian leader’s frustration grows.\nJust over a decade has passed since social media played the role of great liberator, connecting the youth of the Arab world in uprisings against their despotic rulers. But technology, it transpired, was twin-souled like Goethe’s Faust. The organizing tool of the freedom fighter might equally serve the surveillance system of the despot.\nFacebook, owned by Meta, was used by the military in Myanmar to stir a frenzy of hatred against the Muslim Rohingya that led to the mass expulsion and genocide that began in 2016. It was used by Russian intelligence agencies to interfere in the 2016 American election.\nBut the war in Ukraine has demonstrated some lessons learned, as well as the enduring liberalizing potential inherent in a borderless virtual world.\nBig tech companies like Google, Meta and Apple have taken several steps to counter the Russian disinformation that proved so effective in the past. At the same time, their platforms have revealed growing Russian opposition to Mr. Putin’s war and allowed Ukrainian influencers to display the courage of a nation where, from rural village to metropolis, nobody appears to be surrendering. \nIf the idea of truth, in the United States as elsewhere, appeared to have been lost in the disorienting bombardment of social media, with the line between fact and falsehood ever fainter, the sheer enormity of Russian lies — the denial of the existence of a war, for example — appears to have done something to restore its value and importance.\n“Who else but us?” said Zakhar Nechypor, a Ukrainian actor, as he armed himself with a rifle. Who else indeed and what truth more raw?\nIvan Andronic, a plumber who moved from his native Moldova to France 18 years ago, said in an interview that he felt his mother and mother-in-law back in Moldova were now at risk. Mr. Putin could do anything, even embark on nuclear war. “He is very dangerous,” Mr. Andronic said. “We must fight him together, and his own population must turn on him.”\nTogetherness is a word enjoying a revival. The Ukraine war appears to have dented a cycle of growing loneliness in which Covid-19 played a significant part. The unbearable lightness of online being has given way to the unbearable gravity of a European war.\nA break has occurred in the world where people are corralled into herds by social media algorithms, trolls and bots. Where they forsake community to become tribes with megaphones. Where they turn in circles, succumbing to technological neuroticism. Above all, where they grow lonelier, caught in a vortex, starved of connective tissue, hungry for status, often bereft of moral conviction.\nIn their place, quite suddenly, a life-and-death struggle presents itself with its moral imperatives. As Europe initially hesitated, Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister and the president of the European People’s Party, tweeted:\n“In this war everything is real: Putin’s madness and cruelty, Ukrainian victims, bombs falling on Kyiv. Only your sanctions are pretended. Those EU government’s, which blocked tough decisions (i.a. Germany, Hungary, Italy) have disgraced themselves.”\nVery soon, almost overnight, Europe did what it is rarely capable of doing. It united to end that disgrace and face down Mr. Putin.\nAs the German philosopher Hannah Arendt wrote, “Under conditions of terror, most people will comply but some will not. Humanly speaking, no more is required, and no more can reasonably be asked, for this planet to remain a fit place for human habitation.”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/world/europe/ukraine-european-union-membership.html",
      "text": "It was an impassioned plea: President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine this week asked for his country to join the European Union, the world’s biggest trading bloc, which also has helped preserve peace in Europe for decades.\n“We have proven that at a minimum we are exactly the same as you,” he told the European Parliament on Tuesday. “So do prove that you are with us, do prove that you will not let us go, do prove that you indeed are Europeans.” A day earlier, he submitted a formal application for Ukraine’s admission into the union, which is headquartered in Brussels, the Belgian capital.\nWith Russian forces violently pushing into Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky’s request was warmly received by Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the E.U.’s executive branch, who proclaimed on Monday that Ukraine is “one of us and we want them in the European Union.”\nHowever, her words of encouragement were largely symbolic, and Mr. Zelensky’s E.U. aspirations aren’t likely to be satisfied any time soon: Joining the bloc is a painstaking and arduous process that can take as long as a decade.\nPoland, for example, made a formal request to join the bloc in 1994 and was finally admitted in 2004.\nTo join, a country needs its candidacy to be unanimously approved by all E.U. member states, which now number 27. It must also make its political system, judiciary and economy compatible with the bloc by adopting the E.U.’s system of common law, as well as more than 80,000 pages of rules and regulations on everything from environmental standards to food hygiene rules.\nOne senior E.U. official explained that it can take as long as 18 months for the European Commission to evaluate a country’s application before it goes to member countries.\nAnd while there are precedents for fast-tracking — Sweden and Finland managed to join the Union in a few years after applying — a speedy approach is rare. Moreover, other countries have been waiting for years to join, including Albania, Bosnia and Serbia, making it difficult for the E.U. to move faster on Ukraine.\nBeyond that, the E.U. also has expansion fatigue after being buffeted by economic crises, Brexit and the pandemic, as well as the misbehavior of rule-breaking member countries like Hungary.\nAt the moment, Ukraine hasn’t been made an official candidate, but rather has an association agreement with the E.U., signed in 2014 and concluded in 2017, in which it agreed to intensify economic and political ties with the bloc.\nUkrainians have been ardent in wanting to forge closer links with Europe, and in 2013, hundreds of thousands of them took to the streets to protest when the president at the time, Viktor F. Yanukovych, who leaned toward Russia, backtracked on signing an association agreement with the union.\nWhatever the challenges for Ukraine’s E.U. hopes, Russia’s aggression has engendered an outpouring of solidarity in the bloc, drawing some of the toughest sanctions in its history. East and central European countries like Poland and the Baltics, which lived for decades behind the Iron Curtain and where memories of Russian subjugation run deep, have been among the most enthusiastic in backing Ukraine’s membership.\nMost Europeans welcomed the E.U.’s eastward expansion in May 2004, when the bloc admitted 10 mostly former Communist countries — including the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland — because, among other reasons, it cemented the demise of the Soviet bloc, and helped spread economic and political liberalism across the continent.\nThe European Union’s ability to offer membership to a country has been one of its greatest foreign policy tools in the post-Cold-War world. The prospect of joining motivated Bulgaria and Romania to tackle corruption and accelerated the arrest of war criminals in Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro.\nEven though Ukraine’s E.U. membership process is likely to be gradual, the country’s attempt to forge closer ties with NATO and the European Union underlines that President Vladimir V. Putin’s attempt to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s orbit by force appears to be having the opposite effect.",

      "text": "In January, at the height of the Omicron wave, one-quarter of U.S. schoolchildren missed more than a week of in-person learning, according to a national survey of 148,400 parents by The New York Times and the survey and data firm Dynata.\nThe majority of students were home at least three days, and nearly one in 10 were out for half the month or more. The disruptions were spread across the country, with no region spared.\nThe survey revealed more widespread interruptions than other recent measurements have suggested. It demonstrates the degree to which classroom closures have upended children’s education and parents’ routines, even two years into the pandemic.\nFive days of in-person school each week used to be virtually guaranteed. Some parents are now wondering if they’ll get that level of certainty again.\n“I would say I’m about 75 percent certain school will be open” each week, said Noelle Rodriguez, a mother and hair stylist in Fresno, Calif., who moved her salon to her house when it became clear school wouldn’t open last year. “I can’t say 100 percent, which is one of the reasons I stayed working from home.”\nThe reasons for being sent home reached beyond Covid infections and exposures. Schools continued to face the fallout from remote school last year, including burnout and shortages among teachers and staff, and students who are struggling with academics, social skills and classroom behavior. In some cases, teachers have staged sickouts or asked for “wellness” or “school climate” days.\nIt’s much less common than last year for whole districts to close. Instead, schools are shuttering individual buildings or classrooms or quarantining small groups of children or teachers. That has enabled more children to stay in school, but has left little data on the question of how many school days students are missing. The survey, conducted online Feb. 4 to Feb. 16 by Dynata at the request of The Times, asked parents how many weekdays their youngest child was home in January. (The Times asked how many days were missed in total; some parents may have counted Martin Luther King’s Birthday or snow days, and others may not have.)\nIn New York City, roughly a third of students stayed home most days in January. Some districts, including in Atlanta and Detroit, did not reopen after the holiday break as planned, to control the spread of Omicron. In Sandy, Utah, students independently study at home some Fridays to help with teachers’ “exhaustion and burnout.” In Fairview, Ore., a middle school closed for three weeks for student misbehavior.\nThe practice in many school districts reflects a new comfort level with keeping children home, even on short notice, in a way that was rare before pandemic-era remote schooling.",

      "text": "WASHINGTON — Plagued by poor morale as well as fuel and food shortages, some Russian troops in Ukraine have surrendered en masse or sabotaged their own vehicles to avoid fighting, a senior Pentagon official said on Tuesday.\nSome entire Russian units have laid down their arms without a fight after confronting a surprisingly stiff Ukrainian defense, the official said. A significant number of the Russian troops are young conscripts who are poorly trained and ill-prepared for the all-out assault. And in some cases, Russian troops have deliberately punched holes in their vehicles’ gas tanks, presumably to avoid combat, the official said.\nThe Pentagon official declined to say how the military made these assessments — presumably a mosaic of intelligence including statements from captured Russian soldiers and communications intercepts — or how widespread these setbacks may be across the sprawling battlefield. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational developments.\nBut taken together, these factors may help explain why Russian forces, including an ominous 40-mile convoy of tanks and armored vehicles near Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, have come to a near crawl in the past day or two, U.S. officials said.\nBesides dealing with shortages of fuel, food and spare parts, the Pentagon official said, Russian commanders leading that armored column toward Kyiv may also be “regrouping and rethinking” their battle plans, making adjustments on the fly to gain momentum for what U.S. intelligence and military officials say is an inevitable push in the next several days to encircle and ultimately capture the capital.\n“They have a lot of power available to them,” said the Pentagon official, adding that 80 percent of the more than 150,000 Russian troops amassed on Ukraine’s borders have now joined the fight.\nBut U.S. analysts have been struck by the “risk-averse behavior” of such a large force, the Pentagon official said. Russia launched an amphibious landing to seize Mariupol, a pivotal port city on the Sea of Azov, but landed forces around 40 miles from the city. That allowed the Russians extra time and space to mount an invasion, but also gave the city’s defenders time to prepare.\nRussia’s vaunted air force has yet to gain air superiority over Ukraine, with Russian warplanes thwarted by Ukrainian fighter jets and a surprisingly resilient and potent array of air defenses, from shoulder-fired Stinger antiaircraft missiles to much larger surface-to-air weapons, the Pentagon official said.\nFor Russian forces coming out of Belarus, logistics problems have proved stubborn, a European official said on Tuesday.\nAhead of the invasion, U.S. and British intelligence had raised questions about the supply chain for the Russian troops in Belarus. During military exercises there, some of the soldiers were getting inadequate supplies of food and fuel, according to independent analysts. But American officials told allies that the Russians had fixed those problems by mid-February, which was one reason that American warnings about the invasion intensified in the middle of last month, according to the European official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational developments.\nBut the challenges that Russian forces have faced show that their supply chain troubles have not been completely resolved, the European official said.\nThe logistics failures may help explain the presence of the long, slow-moving convoy of military equipment that is coming toward Kyiv, a tactical failure that is presenting a key target for the Ukrainian military, the European official said.\nRussian officials, the European official said, expected to have secured air supremacy, at least around Kyiv. But the fact that Ukrainian air defense systems were still operating has put both Russian aircraft and the convoy of equipment in danger.",

      "headline": "Africans Say Ukrainian Authorities Hindered Them From Fleeing",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/01/world/europe/ukraine-refugee-discrimination.html",
      "text": "Africans who had been living in Ukraine say they were stuck for days at crossings into neighboring European Union countries, huddling in the cold without food or shelter, held up by Ukrainian authorities who pushed them to the ends of long lines and even beat them, while letting Ukrainians through.\nAt least 660,000 people have fled Ukraine in the five days following the start of Russia’s invasion, the United Nations refugee agency U.N.H.C.R. said. Most are Ukrainians, but some are students or migrant workers from Africa, Asia and other regions who are also desperate to escape.\nChineye Mbagwu, a 24-year-old doctor from Nigeria who lived in the western Ukrainian town of Ivano-Frankivsk, said she had spent more than two days stranded at the Poland-Ukraine border crossing in the town of Medyka, as the guards let Ukrainians cross but blocked foreigners.\n“The Ukrainian border guards were not letting us through,” she said in a phone interview, her voice trembling. “They were beating people up with sticks” and tearing off their jackets, she added. “They would slap them, beat them and push them to the end of the queue. It was awful.”\nThe African Union and President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria have condemned the treatment of Africans fleeing Ukraine following social media reports about border guards hindering them from leaving. Africans have also reported being barred from boarding trains headed to the border.\n“Reports that Africans are singled out for unacceptable dissimilar treatment would be shockingly racist” and violate international law, the African Union said.\nUkraine’s deputy interior minister, Anton Heraschenko, denied that his country was obstructing foreigners from leaving.\n“Everything is simple,” he said. “We are first to release women and children. Foreign men must wait for women and children to come forward. We will release all foreigners without hindrance,” he added, in a written response to questions. “Same goes for blacks.”\nMs. Mbagwu, the Nigerian doctor, managed to reach Warsaw, but said she crossed the border only by struggling and pushing her way through.\n“They would say ‘only women and children can pass through,’” she said. “But they were letting some Ukrainian men through. And whenever a Black lady would try to pass, they said: ‘Our women first,’” Ms. Mbagwu added.\n“There was no shelter from the cold. It snowed. There was no food, water, or a place to rest. I was literally hallucinating from sleep deprivation,” she said.\nShe said her 21-year-old brother, a medical student, had been blocked at the border since Friday, but made it into Poland after four days of trying.\nNot all foreigners reported ill treatment by Ukrainian authorities at the border crossings.\nA Pakistani student and an Afghan national who crossed from Ukraine into Poland on Saturday said the only problem was very long lines. And a group of Vietnamese workers crossed easily into Moldova on Monday.\nMohammed Saadaoui, a 23-year-old Moroccan pharmacy student who traveled from the Ukrainian city of Odessa to Warsaw, said he did not have any problems.\n“But we took a long time to find the good border crossing where there would not be too many people,” he said. “There, we were treated the same way as the Ukrainians.”\nThe International Organization of Migration estimated that there are more than 470,000 foreign nationals in Ukraine, including a large number of overseas students and migrant workers. At least 6,000 of them have arrived in Moldova and Slovakia alone over the past five days, according to the I.O.M., and many more have crossed into Poland.\nMany of the foreigners fleeing Ukraine said they were warmly welcomed in neighboring Poland, Moldova, Hungary and Romania. But Mr. Buhari, the Nigerian president, said there were reports of Polish officials refusing Nigerians entry.\nPiotr Mueller, the spokesman for the Polish prime minister, denied this, saying, “Poland is letting in everyone coming from Ukraine regardless of their nationality.”\nPiotr Bystrianin, head of the Ocalenie Foundation, a Polish refugee charity, said that so far, “problems were on the Ukrainian side.”\nMore than 300,000 people have fled from Ukraine to Poland since the Russian invasion began, according to Poland’s interior ministry. Makeshift accommodation is being set up across the country, and Poles are helping Ukrainians on a massive scale, transporting them through the border, hosting them in their homes, feeding and clothing them.\nOn Monday, Poland’s ambassador to the United Nations, Krzysztof Szczerski, said his country welcomed all foreign students who were studying in Ukraine, and invited them to continue their studies in Poland.\nIn the years leading up to the Russian invasion, Poland had taken a hard line on migrants trying to enter the country. The army and border guards have pushed asylum seekers from the Middle East and Africa back into Belarus. Last week, aid organizations said a 26-year-old man from Yemen froze to death at that border.\nSome of the foreigners arriving in Poland from Ukraine over the past few days were exhausted and freezing, according to local aid organizations on the ground. Some were taken directly to hospitals because of their injuries.\nAhmed Habboubi, a 22-year-old French-Tunisian medical student, said all foreign nationals, including Africans, Israelis, Canadians and Americans, were told to go to one gate at the Medyka crossing from Ukraine to Poland, which would only process four people every couple of hours, while Ukrainians were allowed to pass freely through another gate.\n“The Ukrainian army beat me up so much I couldn’t properly walk,” he said in an phone interview. “When I finally managed to enter Poland, the Polish authorities took me straight to the hospital,” he added.\n“It was absolute chaos. We were treated like animals. There are still thousands of people stranded there.”\nHe said that Poland had welcomed him warmly.\nDennis Nana Appiah Nkansah, a Ghanaian medical student, said he saw the same discrimination at the crossing from Ukraine into the Romanian town of Siret — one rule for Ukrainians and another for everyone else. Thousands of foreigners, including Zambians, Namibians, Moroccans, Indians and Pakistanis, were directed to one gate that was mostly closed, while another reserved for Ukrainians was open and people flowed through.\nOver about three hours, four or five foreigners were allowed to leave, while there was a “massive influx” of Ukrainians crossing, he said. “It’s not fair,” he said, but “we understood that they have to see to their people first.”\nMr. Nkansah, 31, said he had organized 74 Ghanaian and Nigerian students to pitch in and hire a bus to flee together. They reached the border early Saturday morning, he said, but it took them 24 hours to cross over.\nEmmanuel Nwulu, 30, a Nigerian student of electronics at Kharkiv National University, said that when he tried to board a train in Ukraine going west toward the border, Ukrainian officials told him, “Blacks could not board the train.” But Mr. Nwulu and his cousin managed to force their way aboard.\nTaha Daraa, a 25-year-old Moroccan student in his fourth year studying dentistry in Dnipro Medical Institute, started his journey out on Saturday around noon and crossed the border into Romania in the early hours of Monday morning after days without sleep.\n“We were treated so badly. We took buses to the Romanian border. It was very scary then we had to walk across the border while hearing gunshots,” he said via WhatsApp. “All we did was pray. Our parents prayed as well for our safety. It’s the only protection we had,” he added.\n“I witnessed a lot of racism.”\nHe said he was in a group with two other Moroccans and many other Africans and he asked a Ukrainian border guard to let them through. The guard started firing his gun in the air to scare them and so they stepped back.\n“I have never felt so much fear in my life,” Mr. Daraa said. “He asked us to move back. Snow was falling on us. As the crowd got bigger, they gave up and let everyone through.”\nHe said the Romanians were taking good care of him and other foreigners and providing them with food and other necessities.\n“They gave us everything,” he said.",

      "headline": "Putin Calls Ukrainian Statehood a Fiction. History Suggests Otherwise.",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/21/world/europe/putin-ukraine.html",
      "text": "KYIV, Ukraine — In his speech to the Russian nation on Monday, President Vladimir V. Putin buoyed his case for codifying the cleavage of two rebel territories from Ukraine by arguing that the very idea of Ukrainian statehood was a fiction.\nWith a conviction of an authoritarian unburdened by historical nuance, Mr. Putin declared Ukraine an invention of the Bolshevik revolutionary leader, Vladimir Lenin, who he said had mistakenly endowed Ukraine with a sense of statehood by allowing it autonomy within the newly created Soviet state.\n“Modern Ukraine was entirely and fully created by Russia, more specifically the Bolshevik, communist Russia,” Mr. Putin said. “This process began practically immediately after the 1917 revolution, and moreover Lenin and his associates did it in the sloppiest way in relation to Russia — by dividing, tearing from her pieces of her own historical territory.”\nAs a misreading of history, it was extreme even by the standards of Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer who has declared the Soviet Union’s collapse the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.\nUkraine and Russia share roots stretching back to the first Slavic state, Kievan Rus, a medieval empire founded by Vikings in the 9th century.\nBut the historical reality of Ukraine is complicated, a thousand-year history of changing religions, borders and peoples. The capital, Kyiv, was established hundreds of years before Moscow, and both Russians and Ukrainians claim it as a birthplace of their modern cultures, religion and language.\nKyiv was ideally situated along the trade routes that developed in the ninth and 10th centuries, and flourished only to see its economic influence diminish as trade shifted elsewhere. The many conquests by warring factions and Ukraine’s diverse geography — with farmland, forests and a maritime environment on the Black Sea — created a complex fabric of multiethnic states.\nThe history and culture of Russia and Ukraine are indeed intertwined — they share the same Orthodox Christian religion, and their languages, customs and national cuisines are related.\nEven so, Ukrainian identity politics and nationalism have been irritants in Russia since the feudal czarist times that predated the Russian Revolution. Ukraine is seen by many Russians as their nation’s “little brother” and should behave accordingly.\nEastern Ukraine, which came under Russian influence much earlier than the west, still features many Russian speakers and people loyal to Moscow. But the happy brotherhood of nations that Mr. Putin likes to paint, with Ukraine fitted snugly into the fabric of a greater Russia, is dubious.\nParts of modern-day Ukraine did indeed reside for centuries within the Russian empire. But other parts in the west fell under the jurisdiction of the Austro-Hungarian empire, Poland or Lithuania.\n“Putin’s argument today that Ukraine is historically subsumed by Russia is just not right,” said Cliff Kupchan, chairman of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting organization. While the themes of Mr. Putin’s speech were not new for the Russian leader, Mr. Kupchan said, “the breadth and vehemence with which he went after all things Ukrainian was remarkable.”\nThe newly created Soviet government under Lenin that drew so much of Mr. Putin’s scorn on Monday would eventually crush the nascent independent Ukrainian state. During the Soviet era, the Ukrainian language was banished from schools and its culture was permitted to exist only as a cartoonish caricature of dancing Cossacks in puffy pants.\nMr. Putin also argued on Monday that the myth of Ukraine was reinforced by the crumbling Soviet government of Mikhail Gorbachev, which allowed Ukraine to slip free of Moscow’s grasp. It was a weakened Moscow that “gave” Ukraine the right to become independent of the Soviet Union “without any terms and conditions.”\n“This is just madness,” he said.\nIt was not Moscow that granted Ukraine’s independence in 1991, but the Ukrainian people, who voted resoundingly to leave the Soviet Union in a democratic referendum.\nNow, with an estimated 190,000 Russian troops surrounding Ukraine like a sickle, Mr. Putin’s declaration that Ukraine’s very existence as a sovereign state was the result of historical error threatened to send a shudder through all the lands once under Moscow’s dominion. It also elicited expressions of contempt from Ukrainians.\n“For the past few decades, the West has been looking for fascism anywhere, but not where it was most,” said Maria Tomak, an activist involved in supporting people from Crimea, a Ukrainian territory Mr. Putin annexed in 2014. “Now it is so obvious that it burns the eyes. Maybe this will finally make the West start to sober up about Russia.”\nIt is not clear whether Mr. Putin believes his version of Ukrainian history or has simply concocted a cynical mythology to justify whatever action he plans next. But his contention that Ukraine exists solely within the context of Russian history and culture is one he has deployed at least as far back as 2008, when he attempted to convince George W. Bush, who had expressed support for Ukraine’s NATO membership, of the country’s nonexistence.\nLast summer, Mr. Putin published a 5,300-word essay that expounded on many of the themes he highlighted in Monday’s speech, including the idea that nefarious Western nations had somehow corrupted Ukraine, leading it away from its rightful place within a greater Russian sphere through what he called a “forced change of identity.”\nFew observers, though, believe that historical accuracy is of much importance to Mr. Putin as he sets forth justifications for whatever he has planned for Ukraine.\n“We can be clear that Putin was not trying to engage in a historical debate about the intertwined histories of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples,’’ said Joshua A. Tucker, a political science professor at New York University and an expert on Russia. Instead, Professor Tucker said, the Russian leader was laying the groundwork for the argument “that Ukraine is not currently entitled to the sorts of rights that we associate with sovereign nations.”\n“It was a signal that Putin intends to argue that a military intervention in Ukraine would not be violating another country’s sovereignty,” he added.\nMoscow had vowed to respect Ukraine’s sovereignty as a condition of Ukraine’s giving up its nuclear weapons after the Soviet collapse. But Mr. Putin, analysts said, has made clear that pledge is of little importance to him. In 2014, after protesters drove a Kremlin-backed government from power in Kyiv, he ordered his military to seize the Crimean Peninsula and then instigated a separatist war that resulted in Ukraine’s de facto loss of two rebel territories in the east.\nOn Monday, Mr. Putin moved to formalize that separation by recognizing those territories, the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, as independent. Soon afterward, he ordered troops into the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics in Eastern Ukraine.\nBut Mr. Putin’s efforts to wrest Ukraine back into Russia’s orbit have, in many ways, had the opposite effect. In a country that was once ambivalent about NATO at best, or openly hostile at worst, polls show that a solid majority now favor membership in the American-led military alliance.\nIn Kyiv, where Ukrainians had been nervously awaiting Mr. Putin’s decision, the reaction to his speech was one of disgust and foreboding.\nKristina Berdynskykh, a prominent political journalist, gathered with colleagues at a bar called Amigos and sat around a phone watching Mr. Putin’s speech, by turns crying and cursing.\n“It is hatred for all of Ukraine and revenge for the country’s movement toward the E.U. and NATO and democracy — albeit chaotic, with huge problems, slow reforms and corruption — but where people elect and change power in elections or revolutions,” Ms. Berdynskykh said. “The worst dream for an old lunatic is both scenarios: fair elections and revolutions.”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/world/europe/kyiv-ukraine-military-casualties.html",
      "text": "KYIV, Ukraine — At a cemetery lined by fir trees in central Kyiv, mourners paid their final respects on Tuesday to Capt. Anton Sidorov, who was arrayed in his army fatigues in a casket.\n“Glory to Ukraine!” said one of Mr. Sidorov’s comrades. “Glory to the heroes!” came the solemn response from the group of mourners, which included dozens of soldiers.\nCaptain Sidorov, 35, was killed on Saturday in eastern Ukraine, near the front line separating government-held territory from breakaway areas backed by Moscow. He was one of the first casualties in a drastic escalation in tensions between Russia and Ukraine that led President Vladimir V. Putin to recognize the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics in Ukraine’s east on Monday, paving the way for sending Russian troops to the region.\nThe funeral reflected the dual emotions coursing through Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, as Mr. Putin received approval for the use of military force from his Parliament, heightening the anticipation of war against Ukraine. Citizens in Kyiv were somber but defiant. They have been preparing for a possible military escalation by Russia for months, with many civilians joining territorial defense units across the country and receiving military training.\nOn Tuesday morning, the day after Mr. Putin gave a menacing speech in which he denigrated Ukraine’s history and threatened “bloodshed,” there were lines outside of recruitment centers.\nBut on the streets and on social media, daily life was mostly proceeding as normal. There was no widespread panic buying in grocery stores or lining up at ATMs. Public figures and celebrities took to social media to express pride in their country with the unflappable conviction of being on the right side of history.\n“Fear and panic are the best allies of a crazy dwarf!” wrote TV presenter Yuri Gorbunov on Facebook, one of many posts trying to disparage Mr. Putin rather than expressing fear of his powerful military.\nStill, some Ukrainians are quietly making contingency plans. Some Kyiv residents were dropping off their pets at animal shelters as they prepared to leave the city for western Ukraine, or to go abroad. Many others were making arrangements to defend their country. Some military and hunting supply stores in the city said they had already run out of weapons.\n“We’re keeping calm and just getting our guns ready,” said Serhiy Kolisnyk, 45, who was wounded while fighting Russia-backed separatists in the coastal city of Mariupol in 2015.\n“We know what the possible vectors of attack are, and we will join the armed forces when we are called upon,” Mr. Kolisnyk said, sitting with two fellow veterans at a wall commemorating soldiers who have died.\nArtur Savoisky, the owner of Pyata Varta, a store that sells weapons in central Kyiv, described what he called “a lot of commotion’’ in recent days.\n“People are buying weapons mostly for their own security, for their self-defense, to protect their homes,” he said.\nHis store still had some ammunition, because he had stocked up months ago.\nMr. Putin’s full plans for Russian troops are still unclear. But Ukraine’s defense minister, Oleksiy Reznikov, seemed to be preparing his soldiers for an escalation in a statement released by the military on Tuesday.\n“Ahead will be a difficult trial,” Mr. Reznikov said. “There will be losses. You will have to go through pain and overcome fear and despondency.”\nMany Ukrainians said they refused to allow the outright falsehoods and pugilistic rhetoric of Mr. Putin to intimidate them.\n“Everything is OK,” said Eugene Okhrimenko, 33, a financial analyst in Kyiv, noting that Ukrainians have been living under the specter of a Russian threat since 2014, when Moscow fomented a separatist incursion in the East and annexed Crimea. “There is lots of anger, but no panic.”\nMany Ukrainians expressed their frustration at the lack of response inside of Russia to Mr. Putin’s warmongering speech, in which he said that Ukraine “was created by Russia’’ and lamented the fact that it received independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n“I can’t explain the silence on the part of my friends and colleagues from ‘brotherly’ Russia,” Pavlo Varenytsa, the frontman of Epolets, a band from the southern city of Odessa, wrote on Facebook.\n“Your silence will affect everyone — us, you, the whole world,” he wrote. “Your silence is a bullet aimed at all of us. As long as you are silent, evil is done by your hands.”\nUkraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky has sought to maintain a measured tone in the face of Mr. Putin’s warmongering.\n“We believe that there will be no powerful war against Ukraine and there will be no wide escalation on the part of the Russian Federation,” Mr. Zelensky said on Tuesday. He said he still believed it was possible to resolve the situation diplomatically.\nSome Ukrainians appreciated Mr. Zelensky’s levelheadedness but were hoping to see their president make more concrete plans.\n“I would like to hear more determination from the president, an action plan for the nation,” said Olha Reshetylova, a human rights media coordinator.\n“But in the end, I understand that we need to leave room for maneuver, and every harsh word, or even more action, significantly reduces the space,” she added. “The main thing is not to make critical mistakes.”\nIn Kyiv on Tuesday, the sun was shining and spring seemed near. But the war, and Mr. Putin’s menacing threats against their nation, suddenly seemed inescapable.\n“I already have him in my dreams!” fruit seller Maryna Kovalenko said of the pugilistic Russian leader. “Of course it is worrying. We have children here. He will not stop.”\nOne of her customers, Vira Zavadska, approached to buy some fruit.\n“It was unavoidable, we always knew it,” she told Ms. Kovalenko. “My daughter has been telling me to leave, but how can I live without our Ukraine? The war has already been here for eight years, and people are dying.”\n“I am so sorry for our sons,” she added, alluding to the death Monday of two more Ukrainian soldiers.\n“I just wish Putin would die.”\nAt Captain Sidorov’s funeral, one of his fellow soldiers said he and his colleagues were not alarmed by the prospect of an increased military incursion.\n“I am ready to return to active service, or to be mobilized in territorial defense,” said the man, who gave his army nickname, Hopak. “We all are.”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/world/europe/putin-invading-ukraine.html",
      "text": "MOSCOW — Slumped in a chair, red tie askew, his staccato delivery emphasizing every grievance, President Vladimir V. Putin delivered a speech on Monday that sounded like a call to war.\nIt was also the culmination of a propaganda barrage orchestrated by Russian state media in recent days — a stark demonstration of how the Kremlin can use its dominance of the airwaves to lay the groundwork for a political decision that could cause widespread pain. \nBy Tuesday afternoon, Russia’s stock market had fallen again, leaving it some 20 percent down in less than a week, as businesses braced for damaging new Western sanctions. And the potential, far more tragic, costs if Mr. Putin were to go ahead with an invasion of Ukraine still appeared incalculable.\nBut to the millions of Russians watching television, the narrative of the last days has been completely different: Booms and flashes of artillery fire. Blurred-out footage of human remains. Women and children, crying and fleeing. A separatist appeal to the president. An emergency meeting of Mr. Putin’s Security Council. A dramatic address to the nation.\nAnd what happens next is a mystery.\nFor months, as Washington warned of a looming Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia’s powerful propaganda machine dismissed and parodied talk of war.\nThen, last weekend, everything changed. From the occupied territory of Ukraine to the halls of the Kremlin, the rationale for a possible invasion was put into place, piece by piece, and presented to the Russian public in an unrelenting push on state television.\nBy Tuesday morning, the breakfast news on state-run Channel 1 was announcing a “historic moment.”\n“Eight years of fear have ended,” the announcer declared, a reference to the residents of separatist-occupied eastern Ukraine who, in the Kremlin’s unfounded claims, are being subjected to “genocide” by Ukrainian forces.\n“We absolutely must help those people,” said Margarita Kurdyukova, a 60-year-old pensioner in Moscow, explaining why she supported Mr. Putin’s decision. “Thank you to our government for at least getting the children and women out.”\nStill, it is too soon to tell how most Russians would react to Mr. Putin’s moves; so far there is none of the widespread jubilation that accompanied his annexation of Crimea in 2014. On Tuesday, as Russian state media claimed that Ukraine was firing at the Russian-backed separatist regions whose independence Mr. Putin recognized on Monday, it remained unclear how far the Kremlin would go in escalating the conflict.\n“Hundreds and soon, tens of thousands of Ukrainians and Russian citizens may die because of Putin,” Aleksei A. Navalny, the imprisoned opposition leader, posted on social media. “Sure, he won’t let Ukraine develop and will drag it into a swamp, but Russia will pay the same price.”\nLawmakers in the lower house of Parliament, the State Duma, hinted on Tuesday that the Kremlin’s campaign against the pro-Western government of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine would not end with Mr. Putin’s recognition of the separatist territories in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region.\nOne nationalist deputy, Andrei Lugovoi, said he hoped that the recognition marked “the beginning of the return of all Ukraine to its historical bosom.” Another, Sergei Mironov, ripped into Mr. Zelensky as a “coward, liar and scoundrel.”\nThe angry, righteous tone was a continuation of the flurry of weekend news reports that aimed to paint an American-backed Ukraine as the aggressor — even though it insists it has no plans to mount an offensive against the separatist-held territories. State media seized upon Western warnings of a possible Russian invasion to paint the United States and its allies as warmongers.\nOn the marquee weekly news show on Russian state television, the host, Dmitri Kiselyov, on Sunday reeled off the international leaders he insisted could profit from war: Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, President Emmanuel Macron of France and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.\n“Everything is very serious,” Mr. Kiselyov warned. “Ukraine is literally being dragged into war with Russia.”\nLater Sunday night, on a weekly show called “Moscow. Kremlin. Putin,” the president’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, reinforced the notion that while war may be coming, it would not be Russia’s choice.\n“Let me remind you that Russia throughout all its history never attacked anyone,” Mr. Peskov said.\nOn Monday, Russian media broadcast separatist claims of an escalating assault by Ukrainian forces and broadcast an array of unsubstantiated claims — that Ukraine was shelling communications, bridges, a water filtration station and other infrastructure targets. Russian state television reported from the separatist-held city of Donetsk that Ukraine had sent saboteurs behind separatist lines.\nOn a YouTube channel run by another state television host, Vladimir Solovyov, a reporter on the ground in the separatist territory described the death of a local resident from Ukrainian shelling.\n“He was torn to pieces,” he said. “There’s a genocide going on, people are being killed.”\nUkrainian officials insisted their military was not preparing an assault against Donetsk, and said the separatists were shelling their own territory.\n Oleksiy Danilov, a senior Ukrainian security official, warned on Monday that Russia was waging a furious disinformation war.\n“A great powerful information provocation is being waged against our state,” Mr. Danilov said. “But it is necessary to trust only official information.”\nBut any Ukrainian protestations were ignored in Russia. The Russian military said it had destroyed two infantry fighting vehicles of the Ukrainian Armed Forces that had crossed into Russian territory in order to try to evacuate Ukrainian saboteurs. As a result, the Russian military said, five people were killed on the Ukrainian side — the first time during the crisis that the Russian military has claimed involvement in a deadly, direct clash with Ukrainian forces. Ukraine denied such an incursion had ever happened.\nFootage of women and children fleeing the separatist territories tugged at heartstrings. On state television Monday, a reporter described government psychologists mobilizing to support the traumatized refugees who had left husbands and fathers behind. \n“I would like to say hello to my Dad,” a young boy was shown saying.\nSoon, state television showed video of the Russian-backed leaders of the separatist territories making appeals directly to Mr. Putin to recognize their independence, neatly leading into a special meeting of the Kremlin’s Security Council later that day. \nThe extraordinary, televised spectacle appeared designed to legitimize Mr. Putin’s fateful decision, casting his decision-making as deliberative and determined — a seeming rebuttal to critics who saw the president as more isolated than ever during the pandemic. \nOn Monday afternoon, Mr. Putin gathered his senior-most officials in the Kremlin’s cavernous Yekaterininsky Hall, presiding over the unscheduled, televised meeting of his Security Council. Because of Covid, he was seated at his own white table with gold trim, while the officials sat in chairs, arrayed in front of him.\n“I would like to underline that I did not discuss anything in advance with any of you,” Mr. Putin said in the middle of the meeting, building the suspense as in a reality show. “What’s happening now is happening on a blank page because I wanted to learn your view without any advance preparation.”\nSome officials appeared visibly nervous, while others made thinly veiled calls for a large-scale military offensive against Ukraine. \nMr. Putin repeatedly interrupted his foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin, as he seemed to equivocate on whether or not to recognize the independence of the Russian-backed separatist republics in Ukraine’s east, prompting Mr. Naryshkin to stutter and then say he was in favor of annexing the territories.\n“That’s not what we’re talking about,” Mr. Putin shot back.\nTo some Russians, the spectacle of the televised meeting underscored that they had no way of influencing decisions being made in the Kremlin. \n“I understand that practically nothing depends on you in this situation,” said Dasha Kryshnikova, a 19-year-old architecture student, in central Moscow. “It’s very strange that a group of people is making a decision on behalf of the whole country.”\nUntil recently, it appeared that many Russians had tuned out talk of an impending war. Pollsters say that while the possibility of war is one of Russians’ greatest fears, no antiwar movement has emerged in recent weeks both because many simply can’t imagine it — or see how they can influence any decisions.\nRussians “feel they can’t influence the process at all,” said Aleksandra Arkhipova, a Moscow social anthropologist, who found that there had been relatively little discussion of a possible war with Ukraine online before the propaganda barrage of recent days. “So they try to avoid it.”\nOn Sunday, a handful of activists unfurled antiwar posters in central Moscow’s Pushkin Square and were promptly arrested. One of the protesters, Lev Ponomarev, a Soviet-era human-rights activist, insisted that while for the moment many still could not imagine a war, most Russians would oppose it if it actually happened.\n“There will be no support for this war,” Mr. Ponomarev said in an interview on Monday. “It will be the collapse of this regime.”",

      "text": "WASHINGTON — Fears of an armed conflict in Ukraine after Russia ordered troops into separatist territories pose a new threat to a global economy that has been struggling to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic and coping with record levels of inflation, analysts warned on Tuesday.\nEuropean countries and the United States are rolling out sanctions in response to the Kremlin’s actions, most of which are expected to target Russian banks and oligarchs. But they are expected to roil energy markets and fuel additional commodity price increases. The uncertainty follows a year of supply chain obstructions that have disrupted the flow of commerce around the world.\n“Should the Russian incursion into eastern Ukraine turn into a full-fledged invasion, it is likely that the global and U.S. economies will absorb yet another supply shock,” said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at the audit and tax firm RSM US.\nMr. Brusuelas projected that an “energy shock” could shave 1 percent off the United States’ gross domestic product in the next year and push the inflation rate up to 10 percent. That could raise the need for policy support to help lower-income workers weather rising food, fuel and goods prices.\nOil prices approached $100 a barrel on Tuesday, the highest in more than seven years, and European gas futures spiked 13 percent after Russia ordered troops into separatist territories in Ukraine. Analysts said that an escalating conflict could also lead to widening credit spreads and weigh on global stock prices.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany said Tuesday that his country would halt certification of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline that would link it with Russia.\nFallout from additional sanctions would most likely land more directly on European countries because of their heavy reliance on Russian natural gas.\n“For the euro area economy, the main threat from tensions between Ukraine and Russia is a stagflationary shock in which financial conditions tighten and energy prices soar,” Claus Vistesen and Melanie Debono, economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients.\nBut the economic impact of the sanctions could be more muted than the saber rattling would suggest.\nEconomists at Capital Economics noted that Russia’s external debt and ties to other advanced economies have waned since the 2014 Crimea crisis, insulating its economy from efforts to cut it off from the global financial system. They predicted that the most likely sanctions measures could shave around 1 percent from Russia’s gross domestic product.\nThe Ukrainian economy will most likely face the most acute pain because of its fragile balance sheet and need for foreign assistance.\n“At the risk of stating the obvious, the biggest economic impact will be on Ukraine,” Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, said. “Depending on the evolution of the conflict, this could be challenging to coordinate.”",

      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/world/europe/trump-putin-russia-ukraine.html",
      "text": "As President Biden announced sanctions against Russia and warned of more if President Vladimir V. Putin did not withdraw his forces from Ukraine, former President Donald J. Trump on Tuesday praised Mr. Putin’s aggression as “genius” and called the Russian leader “very savvy” for describing the troops aligned on the Ukrainian border as peacekeepers. \nMr. Trump’s praise for a foreign adversary in a geopolitical confrontation with a sitting United States president was extraordinary for any former president, even one with a long history of cozying up to Mr. Putin, dating to his first presidential campaign.\nIn July 2016, Mr. Trump directly appealed to the Russians to hack the emails of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, and make them public, the same day that the Russians made their first effort to break into the servers used by Mrs. Clinton’s personal office. \nOnce elected, Mr. Trump broke with decades of American precedent and repeatedly showed unusual deference toward Russia and expressed admiration for Mr. Putin, among other strongman leaders. \nWeeks after taking office, Mr. Trump brushed aside Mr. Putin’s human rights transgressions during an interview with Bill O’Reilly, then of Fox News. \n“You got a lot of killers,” he said. “What, you think our country’s so innocent?”\nIn 2018, Mr. Trump stood alongside Mr. Putin at the end of a summit meeting in Helsinki, Finland, and publicly challenged the conclusion of his own intelligence agencies that Moscow had interfered in the 2016 election, an enormous demonstration of trust in a leader accused of attacking American democracy.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump also ridiculed President Biden and accused him of failing to address Mr. Putin’s recognition late Monday of two Russia-backed separatist territories in Ukraine as independent republics, saying, “There was no response,” and calling this “very sad.” \nMr. Trump’s remarks were broadcast on a conservative talk radio show hosted by Clay Travis and Buck Sexton around the same time that Mr. Biden addressed the nation and announced a first set of sanctions against Russia.\nMr. Trump made no mention on the radio show of his impeachment in 2019 for a pressure campaign on Ukraine to incriminate Mr. Biden and aid his own re-election campaign, a charge he was acquitted of in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n“Putin is now saying, ‘It’s independent,’ a large section of Ukraine. I said, ‘How smart is that?’ And he’s going to go in and be a peacekeeper,” Mr. Trump said. “That’s the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen. There were more army tanks than I’ve ever seen. They’re going to keep peace, all right. No, but think of it. Here’s a guy who’s very savvy.” \nSince Mr. Trump left office, Republicans have split on how to respond to Russian aggression. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and others have called for harsh sanctions against Russia, while Trump supporters such as the Fox News host Tucker Carlson and J.D. Vance, a Senate candidate in Ohio, have argued that the United States should not punish Russia. \nIn a statement released Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump said the Russian aggression toward Ukraine would not have happened if he were still president. \nDuring the radio interview, Mr. Trump said he and Mr. Putin had discussed a potential invasion of Ukraine when Mr. Trump was in the White House. “I knew that he always wanted Ukraine. I used to talk to him about it,” Mr. Trump said. “I said, ‘You can’t do it. You’re not going to do it.’ But I could see that he wanted it. I used to ask him. We used to talk about it at length.”",

      "headline": "‘Rather Very Human’: As Election Nears, Macron Tries to Soften His Image",
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/world/europe/france-election-emmanuel-macron.html",
      "text": "PARIS — Rarely has a modern French leader embraced the powers of the presidency as forcefully as Emmanuel Macron. From his earliest days in office, Mr. Macron was called “Jupiter” by the news media, the king of the gods who ruled by hurling down lightning bolts.\nBut if that image has helped Mr. Macron push through his agenda, it has also made him a special focus of anger among his opponents in a way extraordinary, even by the standards of a country where the power of the presidency has little equivalent in other Western democracies. “Death to the king” has been a frequent cry in recent years during street protests, along with makeshift guillotines.\nAs elections approach in April, that image has also become a political liability and left Mr. Macron struggling to strike the right balance between quasi king and electoral candidate in a political culture that swings between an attachment to monarchy and a penchant for regicide.\n“I’m someone who’s rather emotional, but who hides it,” the president said, lowering his eyes in the gilded ballroom of the Élysée Palace, during a recent two-hour television interview. “I’m someone who’s rather very human, I believe,” he said.Mr. Macron, the Le Monde newspaper wrote, sought to “symbolically kill Jupiter.”\nStill, Mr. Macron has taken full advantage of presidential prerogatives to so far avoid even declaring his candidacy for a second term — though it is considered a foregone conclusion. That has allowed him to delay descending from the throne of the “republican monarch,” as the presidency is sometimes called, to engage in early battle with his opponents.\nInstead, to increasing criticism, he has run a stealth campaign for months, reaching out to voters and leaving his challengers to squabble among themselves.\n“His goal is to show that he’s a good-natured monarch, a human monarch, but with authority,” said Jean Garrigues, a leading historian on France’s political culture. “His challengers’ goal is to show Macron as a helpless monarch, someone who has the powers of a monarch, but who’s incapable of putting them to use.”\n“That’s the great French paradox,” Mr. Garrigues added. “A people permanently in search of participatory democracy who, at the same time, expects everything of their monarch.”\nFrance’s president as a “republican monarch” was the product of the father of the Fifth Republic, Charles de Gaulle. The wartime hero and peacetime leader, through a disputed national referendum in 1962, turned the presidency into a personalized, popularly elected office, an all-powerful providential figure.\n“You have power around one man who is the politician with the most power in his system of all Western nations,” said Vincent Martigny, a professor of political science at the University of Nice and an expert on leadership in democracies. “There is no equivalent of the power of the president of the republic, with checks that are so weak.”\nUnder Mr. Macron, the national assembly has become even less of a counterweight. His party, La République en Marche, was a vehicle he created for his candidacy; many of its lawmakers, who hold a majority in the national assembly, are neophytes beholden to him.\nMr. Macron, experts say, chose two weak prime ministers in a bid to exercise direct control over the government, even replacing his first prime minister after he became too popular. At the same time, as president, Mr. Macron is not held accountable by Parliament, unlike prime ministers.\n“We shouldn’t mix the roles of the president and the prime minister,” said Philippe Bas, a center-right senator who served as secretary general under President Jacques Chirac in the Élysée Palace. “What Macron has done is to absorb the function of the prime minister, which is a problem because he can’t appear in Parliament to defend his draft laws.”\nThat imbalance has allowed Mr. Macron to push economic reforms through Parliament, sometimes with little consultation — or no vote, in the case of an overhaul of the French pension system that had provoked weeks of strikes and street protests, but was ultimately put on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nMr. Macron oversaw a crackdown on Yellow Vest protesters that raised the issue of police violence to a national level. His pandemic measures were adopted behind the closed doors of a “defense council,” and included a state of emergency and one of the strictest lockdowns among democracies. He has not fulfilled an earlier pledge to empower Parliament by introducing proportional representation.\nMr. Macron’s full embrace of presidential prerogatives and his image of aloofness combined to expose the limits of France’s democratic institutions, Mr. Martigny said. Protesters have directed their anger at Mr. Macron, he added, because the increasingly weak Parliament and other government institutions are incapable of addressing their concerns.\n“Doubts about the institution of the presidency have come to the fore much more during Macron’s five years in office, especially during the Yellow Vest crisis, which showed there was a real problem with the system,” Mr. Martigny said.\nHe added that Mr. Macron tried to work around the institutional limits with democratic experiments. He defused the Yellow Vest protests, which were set off by a rise in the gasoline tax, by single-handedly engaging in marathon town hall events for two months in a “great debate.” And he announced the creation of a citizens panel to draw up proposals on climate change.\nBut the experiments simply showed that power flowed through the presidency, Mr. Martigny said. “The debate came to an abrupt end,” he said. \nBrice Teinturier, the director of the Ipsos polling firm in France, said that Mr. Macron, realizing his Jupiterian image was a liability during the Yellow Vest crisis, has by now largely succeeded in turning his strong “Bonapartist” style into an electoral advantage. He noted that 60 percent of voters said Mr. Macron had presidential stature, 20 percentage points more than his closest rivals.\n“Even those who didn’t vote for him recognize in him this presidential dimension,” Mr. Teinturier said. “It rests on a mix of personification, decision-making, a style that is flamboyant, too much so for some people, that brings back an image of arrogance that still sticks to him. But it commands admiration.”\nOutside France, with his talk of a “start-up nation” and of transcending traditional politics, Mr. Macron projected an image of modernity early on. But in France, even before he ran for president in 2016, he had raised eyebrows with what Mr. Garrigues, the historian, described as an “almost reactionary conception” of the presidency.\nMr. Macron rejected his two predecessors’ attempts to modernize the institution, Mr. Garrigues said. In an interview in 2015 with the magazine Le 1, Mr. Macron said that democracies were incomplete. “In French politics,” he said, “the absent figure is that of the king, whose death I think fundamentally the French people did not want.”\nOnce elected, Mr. Macron moved to fill that supposed void — giving his victory speech in front of the Louvre, the former royal residence, and visiting the tombs of past kings at the St.-Denis Basilica. His spokesman at the time even framed Mr. Macron’s pressing the flesh in crowds as a “form of transcendence”: “The king touches you, God heals you.”\nGaspard Koenig, a philosopher who has begun a quixotic presidential campaign, described de Gaulle’s transformation of the presidency as a “democratic trauma” for France. The current system inspires unrealistic expectations among voters, who have grown increasingly disillusioned, he said.\n“One man is supposed to save everybody and is guilty of all the wrongs in the country,” Mr. Koenig said.\nEven as Mr. Macron has tried to shed his Jupiterian image, in his recent interview, he still spoke from the royal grandeur of the Élysée Palace’s ballroom, noted Alexis Lévrier, a historian who analyzed Mr. Macron’s relationship with the news media. Sometimes he slipped into the tone of a king addressing his people, albeit now perhaps kinder than before, Mr. Lévrier added.\nMr. Macron acknowledged saying hurtful things during his presidency, like describing society as divided between “people who succeed and people who are nothing.” He had learned, he said.\nAs the television camera framed Mr. Macron’s face in a close-up, he said he had learned “to better love” the French people, “with more indulgence, benevolence.”",

      "text": "In the last three and a half months, as U.S. officials watched President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia mount what appeared to be preparations to invade Ukraine, President Biden made three critical decisions about how to handle Russia’s provocations, according to interviews with more than a dozen senior administration officials and others who requested anonymity to discuss confidential meetings.\nFirst, the president approved early on a recommendation to share intelligence far more broadly with allies than was typical, officials said. The idea was to avoid disagreements about tough economic sanctions by ensuring that everyone knew what the United States knew about Mr. Putin’s actions.\nSecond, Mr. Biden gave the green light for an unprecedented public information campaign against Mr. Putin. With the support of his top intelligence officials — and with a promise to protect the intelligence agencies’ “sources and methods” — the president allowed a wave of public releases aimed at preventing Mr. Putin from employing his usual denials to divide his adversaries.\nThird, when it became clear this year that Mr. Putin was continuing to build up forces at Ukraine’s border, the president approved sending Ukraine more weapons, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, and deploying more troops to other countries in Eastern Europe as a show of solidarity with Ukraine and to reassure nervous allies on NATO’s eastern flank.",

      "text": "BRUSSELS — European Union ambassadors were preparing on Tuesday to adopt an immediate set of sanctions in response to Russia’s recognition of two separatist regions in Ukraine, according to two E.U. diplomats with knowledge of the talks in Brussels.\nThe sanctions, which will target people, government and business entities in the separatist regions and in Russia, were set to be further reviewed at an informal meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Paris later Tuesday. The ambassadors were then set to approve the package on Tuesday evening, the diplomats said, although they said that meeting could run into the early hours Wednesday.\nThe diplomats said the draft included 27 individuals and entities, including political, military, business and financial entities, as well as “propagandists” linked to the recognition decision.\nSome are geographically inside the separatist areas, the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, diplomats said. But the draft also includes the 11 members of Russia’s Parliament who proposed the recognition and 351 members who voted in favor of it, the diplomats said.\nThe diplomats said the individuals and entities would be subject to European Union-wide asset freezes and travel bans. They said that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was not on the list currently under consideration.\nA statement by the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the European Council president, Charles Michel, said the sanctions would target “those who were involved in the illegal decision,” as well as banks that are “financing Russian military and other operations in Luhansk and Donetsk.”\nIt added that the goal was that “those responsible clearly feel the economic consequences of their illegal and aggressive actions.”\nE.U. sanctions, like those imposed by the United States, are legal decisions that require a formal bureaucratic process before taking effect. The diplomats involved said the E.U. institutions and legal service were taking steps so that the decisions could be legally enforced as soon as possible after being approved by the ambassadors.\nThe European Union intends to adopt wider sanctions if Russia outright invades Ukraine, and E.U. leaders and officials have touted such penalties as economically debilitating. But European leaders have not fully agreed on what would constitute a trigger for that decision, and the content of the larger sanctions package is still being debated.\nIn neighboring Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday that he would introduce sanctions against five Russian banks and take measures against three wealthy individuals from Russia. They would be barred from Britain and any assets they held in the country would be frozen, Mr. Johnson told Parliament.",

      "text": "Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Tuesday that he had canceled a planned meeting with his Russian counterpart, but that the United States would continue to pursue diplomacy if Russia takes steps to de-escalate its aggression against Ukraine.\nMr. Blinken had been scheduled to depart Wednesday morning to meet with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov. Speaking to reporters at the State Department alongside Ukraine’s visiting foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, Mr. Blinken said he had sent Mr. Lavrov a letter calling off the meeting.\n“The further renewed Russian invasion of Ukraine that has now begun means clearly that the idea of having a meeting this week with Foreign Minister Lavrov, to pursue diplomacy — diplomacy now rejected by Russia — does not make sense,” Mr. Blinken said.\nMr. Kuleba said that his government would also seek to pursue diplomacy if possible to forestall a full Russian invasion. If that fails, he added, his people would “fight for every inch of our land, and every city, and every village. To fight until we win.”\nMr. Kuleba said his government appreciated the new sanctions against Russia imposed by the Biden administration. But he called for even stronger action.\n“The world must respond with all its economic might to punish Russia for the crimes it has already committed, and ahead of the crimes it plans to commit,” he said. “Hit Russia’s economy now, and hit it hard.”",

      "text": "Queen Elizabeth II will miss all virtual engagements on Tuesday because of mild symptoms from the coronavirus, Buckingham Palace said on Tuesday.\n“As Her Majesty is still experiencing mild coldlike symptoms she has decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements today, but will continue with light duties,” the palace said in a statement. “Further engagements over the coming week will be decided upon nearer the time.”\nThe 95-year-old monarch tested positive for the coronavirus on Sunday. She had met this month with her elder son and heir, Prince Charles, who was later reported to be reinfected with the coronavirus and went into isolation.\nIn a previous statement published on Sunday, the palace did not address whether Charles was the source of the infection. But officials have pointed to a recent outbreak of cases at Windsor Castle, suggesting she could have been infected by others in the royal household. The palace had previously said that the queen was “experiencing mild coldlike symptoms,” and that she would “continue light duties” over the coming week.\nOn Monday, she sent a message of condolence to the people of Brazil after deadly flooding and mudslides in the city of Petrópolis, a mountainous region north of Rio de Janeiro.\nBuckingham Palace has labored to protect the queen from exposure to the virus. She retreated to Windsor Castle in early 2020 with her husband, Prince Philip, and lived in virtual quarantine for more than a year.\nElizabeth received a dose of a coronavirus vaccine in January 2021 at Windsor Castle, along with Philip. The palace has not confirmed any subsequent vaccine doses. Charles has said that he is fully vaccinated and boosted.\nThe queen’s illness comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson moved to lift coronavirus restrictions in England.",
