Each teenage woman goes through a family tradition: mastering a signature apple-based recipe to feed her future husband. (There are a lot of apples in Ashe County, N.C.) My great-grandmother made tarts; my grandmother, pies; my sister, cakes and strudel. My cooking fails were not so laudable. I burned dozens of desserts before I came out as gay. Fortunately, my family accepts me, and we still cook together. Being queer in Appalachia can be sour, but also sweet. My family saves their apple cores and peels, and I ferment apple cider vinegar. — Laken Brooks', 'concrete': None, 'weights': {'Convincing Victory Disguises Steep Challenges for Macron': {'As mask
